            <summary></summary> 
            <div class="description-content"><p><strong>Core Concept:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>"Retroactive Preparation":</strong> Instead of a player having to declare every single piece of equipment they're carrying or every meticulous plan their character has made <em>before</em> an event unfolds, the Ubik mechanic allows them to declare certain preparations <em>after</em> a situation arises where those preparations would be beneficial.</li>
<li><strong>Narrative Focus:</strong> It prioritizes the cool, "aha!" moments and cinematic reveals over strict adherence to pre-declared inventories or plans. It's about making the characters seem more competent and prepared, even if the player didn't think of it beforehand.</li>
<li><strong>Cost Involved:</strong> To prevent it from being a "win button," there's typically a cost associated with using the Ubik mechanic. This could be:
<ul>
<li><strong>A resource:</strong> A special "Ubik point" or "inspiration" pool that gets depleted.</li>
<li><strong>Increased difficulty:</strong> The next related action might become harder.</li>
<li><strong>A trade-off:</strong> Gaining an advantage in one area might create a new complication elsewhere.</li>
<li><strong>Limited uses:</strong> Perhaps a certain number of uses per session or scenario.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How it Plays Out (Examples):</strong></p>

<p>Imagine a scenario in "RetroFutur JDR" where your character is chasing a villain through a crowded marketplace. The villain slips away around a corner, and you're about to make a roll to catch them, but it looks like you might fail.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Without Ubik:</strong> You'd likely fail the roll, and the villain would escape.</li>
<li><strong>With Ubik:</strong> You could declare, "Actually, I anticipated this. Before the chase began, I paid off a street vendor to trip anyone matching the villain's description if they ran past their stall." You then spend an Ubik point (or incur some other cost), and the GM might rule that the villain is now delayed, or your next roll to catch them gains a significant bonus, or perhaps you just "succeed" in catching them due to this clever preparation.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Another Example:</strong></p>

<p>Your team is infiltrating a high-security facility, and you realize you need a specific type of keycard to access a restricted area, which you hadn't declared bringing.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>With Ubik:</strong> You might say, "My character, always one step ahead, actually picked the pocket of a guard back at the entrance, just in case a unique keycard was needed. I just didn't mention it at the time." You pay the cost, and now you have the keycard.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why "Ubik"?</strong></p>

<p>The name directly references Philip K. Dick's novel <em>Ubik</em>. In the book, Ubik is a mysterious spray that can temporarily reverse the decay of reality. The mechanic in "RetroFutur JDR" mirrors this by allowing players to "spray" a little bit of prepared reality into the narrative, making it work for them retroactively.</p>

<p><strong>Benefits of the Ubik Mechanic:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Empowers Players:</strong> It gives players more agency and the feeling that their characters are highly competent and capable, fitting the often pulp-sci-fi or techno-noir feel of "RetroFutur JDR."</li>
<li><strong>Encourages Creativity:</strong> It allows players to think creatively about solutions without being bogged down by meticulously planning every detail beforehand.</li>
<li><strong>Maintains Pacing:</strong> It can prevent situations where the game grinds to a halt because players forgot a crucial item or didn't anticipate a specific need. Instead of a hard stop, the narrative can continue flowing with a clever "Ubik" moment.</li>
<li><strong>Fuels Narrative Drama:</strong> The reveal of a hidden preparation can be a very satisfying narrative beat, making the characters seem smarter and more resourceful.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Drawbacks (if not managed well):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Can feel "Deus Ex Machina":</strong> If the cost isn't significant enough or it's overused, it can feel like the players are just pulling solutions out of thin air without real consequence.</li>
<li><strong>GM Adaptation:</strong> The GM needs to be skilled at incorporating these retroactive declarations smoothly into the ongoing narrative without undermining previous events or logical consistency too much.</li>

        <p><em><small>In Shadow of the Demon Lord (SotDL), "Ancestry" is akin to "race" or "species" in other tabletop RPGs, but with its own unique flavor and mechanical implications. It's a foundational choice in character creation and continues to influence your character as they advance.</small></em></p>

        <p style="margin-left:5em;"><small>
        <details class="accordion-desc">
            <summary></summary> 
            <div class="description-content"><p><strong>1. Core Identity at Level 0:</strong><br />
* <strong>Starting Point:</strong> When you create a character, the very first major decision you make is your Ancestry. This defines your character's people and their fundamental characteristics.<br />
* <strong>Attribute Scores:</strong> Each Ancestry comes with a default set of starting attribute scores (Strength, Agility, Intellect, Will). While these are fixed baselines, you usually have the option to increase one attribute by 1 point while decreasing another by 1 point, allowing for some customization.<br />
* <strong>Derived Attributes:</strong> Ancestry also determines your starting values for derived attributes like Size, Speed, Health, Healing Rate, Perception, Power, Insanity, and Corruption.<br />
* <strong>Talents and Abilities:</strong> Each Ancestry grants specific talents or special abilities unique to that people. For example, dwarves might have darkvision and bonuses against certain hated enemies, while goblins might be agile and sneaky.<br />
* <strong>Languages and Professions:</strong> Ancestries often dictate starting languages and can influence initial professions (which function more as descriptive background skills in SotDL, offering boons in relevant situations).<br />
* <strong>Random Tables for Flavor:</strong> The core book provides optional random tables for each Ancestry to help you flesh out your character's backstory, appearance, age, personality, and other interesting details. This is not mandatory, but can be a great source of inspiration.</p>

<p><strong>2. Ancestry as a Foundation, Not a "Class":</strong><br />
* Unlike some games where race might dictate a class path, in SotDL, Ancestry is distinct from your "Path" (which is SotDL's equivalent of a class). You choose a Novice Path at Level 1, an Expert Path at Level 3, and potentially a Master Path later. Your Ancestry provides your initial foundation, and your Paths then build upon that.</p>

<p><strong>3. Continued Benefits:</strong><br />
* Your Ancestry isn't just a starting choice; it continues to provide benefits as your character progresses. Notably, characters gain <strong>additional benefits from their Ancestry at Level 4</strong>. This can include things like increased Health, a new talent, or the option to learn a spell.</p>

<p><strong>4. Diverse and Thematic Options:</strong><br />
* The core SotDL rulebook typically includes a variety of Ancestries beyond the standard fantasy fare. While humans and dwarves are present, you'll also find unique options like:<br />
    * <strong>Changelings:</strong> Creatures made of natural materials masquerading as mortals, with the ability to steal likenesses.<br />
    * <strong>Clockworks:</strong> Sentient constructs with mechanical bodies, offering different strengths and weaknesses.<br />
    * <strong>Goblins:</strong> Often depicted as cursed fey, living in the shadows of society.<br />
    * <strong>Orcs:</strong> Reimagined as magically engineered slave-soldiers who rebelled and now hold power.<br />
* Many more Ancestries have been introduced in supplemental materials, offering a wide range of character concepts.</p>

<p><strong>5. Dark Fantasy Integration:</strong><br />
* Ancestries in SotDL are often designed to fit the grim and dark fantasy setting. Some Ancestries might start with initial Corruption (a measure of soul taint), or have inherent vulnerabilities that reflect the world's dangers.</p>

        <p><em><small>In Fate TTRPG, "compelling an aspect" is a fundamental mechanic that drives the narrative forward by creating complications, drama, and choices for the player characters. As the Game Master (GM), you have a special role in this.</small></em></p>

            <div class="description-content"><p><strong>The Core Idea of Compelling:</strong></p>

<p>A compel happens when an aspect (a descriptive phrase that's true about a character, scene, or situation) creates a <strong>complication</strong> or <strong>interesting turn of events</strong> for a character. It's about using the established truths of the game to make things more dramatic, challenging, or character-driven.</p>

<p><strong>GM Compels vs. Player Compels:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>GM Compels:</strong> The GM can compel any aspect (on a PC, NPC, scene, or setting) for free. They don't spend a Fate point to propose the compel. Their goal is to make the story interesting and reward players for embracing their characters' challenges.</li>
<li><strong>Player Compels:</strong> Players can also compel aspects (their own, other PCs', or even NPCs') but usually have to spend a Fate point to do so (unless it's a self-compel, which is free). The Fate point goes to the compelled player.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How a GM Compels an Aspect:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Identify a Relevant Aspect:</strong> Look at the aspects in play ‚Äì especially the player characters' High Concept and Trouble aspects, but also any situation aspects on the scene. Think about how one of these aspects could logically lead to a complication.</li>
<li><strong>Propose the Complication:</strong> Offer the player a narrative suggestion for how their aspect might cause trouble. This can take two main forms:
<ul>
<li><strong>Decision Compel:</strong> The aspect influences a choice the character makes.
<ul>
<li><em>Example:</em> Player character has "Loyal to the Old King." GM: "Because you are <strong>Loyal to the Old King</strong>, you feel honor-bound to defend his ancestral sword, even though it means standing alone against three assassins."</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Event Compel:</strong> Something happens to the character because of the aspect.
<ul>
<li><em>Example:</em> Player character has "Hot-Headed and Reckless." GM: "Your <strong>Hot-Headed and Reckless</strong> nature means that as you burst through the door, you don't notice the tripwire, and a net drops on you!"</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Offer a Fate Point:</strong> When you propose a compel, you <em>offer</em> the player a Fate point. This is the mechanical incentive for them to accept the complication.</li>
<li><strong>Player's Choice: Accept or Refuse:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accept:</strong> If the player accepts the compel, they take the Fate point, and the suggested complication happens. They then narrate how their character deals with that complication. This is the primary way players earn Fate points in Fate.</li>
<li><strong>Refuse:</strong> If the player doesn't want the complication to happen, they can refuse it by paying one of their own Fate points to the GM's Fate point pool. They then narrate how their character <em>avoids</em> or <em>overcomes</em> that specific complication. If a player has no Fate points, they <em>must</em> accept the compel.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Negotiation (Optional but Common):</strong> The exact wording of the compel isn't set in stone. The GM and player can (and often should) briefly negotiate the details of the complication to ensure it's interesting, makes sense for the character, and drives the story in a compelling direction. The goal isn't to punish the player, but to create drama.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Why GM Compels are so Important:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Drives the Narrative:</strong> Compels are the engine of dramatic storytelling in Fate. They introduce twists, turns, and new challenges, preventing the story from becoming stagnant.</li>
<li><strong>Rewards Engaging Play:</strong> Players are encouraged to create interesting, double-edged aspects for their characters because those are the ones that get compelled, leading to more Fate points. This reinforces the idea that character flaws and complexities are valuable.</li>
<li><strong>Keeps Fate Points Flowing:</strong> Compels are the primary way Fate points enter the players' hands. This ensures players have the resources to invoke aspects later on when they want to be awesome and succeed at critical moments.</li>
<li><strong>Reinforces Character Identity:</strong> When a character's "Trouble" aspect consistently comes back to bite them, it reinforces who that character is and how their flaws influence their journey.</li>
<li><strong>GM's Toolkit:</strong> Compels give the GM a powerful, free tool to adjust the narrative pace, introduce new antagonists, or simply make things more exciting without having to rely solely on dice rolls.</li>

            <div class="description-content"><p><strong>What are BPNs?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Job Assignments:</strong> BPNs are official assignments issued by SLA Industries to its Operatives. They cover every conceivable task the mega-corporation needs done to maintain control, deal with threats, and keep its vast, decaying empire running.</li>
<li><strong>Color-Coded Classification:</strong> Each BPN is color-coded, indicating the general nature, difficulty, and often the moral implications of the mission. This is a crucial aspect of the system, as the color quickly communicates what an Operative is getting into.</li>
<li><strong>Media and Public Perception:</strong> A significant portion of Operative work, including many BPNs, is televised live on various channels like "3rd Eye News" or "Gorezone." This is a key element of SLA Industries' "Bread and Circuses" strategy to keep the populace entertained and passive. Operatives are essentially reality TV stars, and their performance on BPNs can impact their fame and sponsorship deals.</li>
<li><strong>Progression and Rewards:</strong> Completing BPNs earns Operatives money (credits, or "unis" for civilians), increases their SCL (Security Clearance Level), and potentially gains them notoriety. Higher SCLs grant access to better gear, living conditions, and more sensitive, lucrative (and dangerous) BPNs.</li>
<li><strong>Variety of Tasks:</strong> BPNs can range wildly in scope and tone, from mundane maintenance to high-stakes combat and covert operations. This allows for a great deal of flexibility in game design, ensuring diverse scenarios for players.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Common BPN Color Codes and Their Implications:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Blue BPNs:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Nature:</strong> These are the most common and lowest-level missions, often involving mundane, grimy, and low-paying tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Street maintenance, clearing sewers of undesirables (mutants, scavs, etc.), crowd control in Downtown, investigating minor disturbances.</li>
<li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Relatively menial, but can still become dangerous in the unpredictable environment of Mort.</li>
<li><strong>SCL:</strong> Typically low SCL requirement, often for new Operatives.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Yellow BPNs:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Nature:</strong> Often involve more general law enforcement, security, or "problem-solving" tasks than Blue BPNs. They might be a bit more complex or require more active investigation.</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Patrolling specific areas, responding to local gang disputes, securing corporate assets, basic retrieval missions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Green BPNs:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Nature:</strong> These tend to be more combat-oriented or involve significant threats.</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Hunting down known criminals or "Subversives," dealing with larger outbreaks of hostile creatures, suppressing riots, or responding to armed incidents.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>White BPNs:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Nature:</strong> Primarily investigative or detective work, often involving mysterious crimes or unusual phenomena. These require more brains than brawn.</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Investigating corporate espionage, serial killings, unexplained disappearances, or strange occurrences related to the "Dream" or the "Ebb."</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Red BPNs:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Nature:</strong> Emergency response missions, often involving critical threats or immediate danger. These are "Red Alerts."</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Responding to terrorist attacks, major breakdowns in infrastructure, large-scale mutant incursions, or situations requiring immediate heavy combat intervention.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Silver BPNs:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Nature:</strong> Often involve diplomatic missions, public relations, or more specialized, sensitive tasks that require a delicate touch. These might involve interacting with powerful NPCs or navigating complex social situations.</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Escorting important personnel, acting as spokespeople, performing PR stunts, or negotiating with troublesome factions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Jade BPNs:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Nature:</strong> Often involve environmental or biological hazards, or dealing with strange, mutated lifeforms.</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Containment of bio-hazards, dealing with out-of-control vat-grown monsters, or investigating ecological disasters.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Black BPNs:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Nature:</strong> These are highly dangerous, often covert, "black ops" missions that SLA Industries wants kept completely off the record. They are often suicidal or morally questionable.</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Assassinations, sabotage, deep infiltrations, dealing with highly classified threats, or missions involving secrets of the World of Progress.</li>
<li><strong>Risk:</strong> Extremely high risk, often with little to no public recognition, and potentially severe consequences if things go wrong.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Platinum BPNs:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Nature:</strong> The highest level of BPN, reserved for the most elite Operatives and concerning the most top-secret, sensitive, or world-altering matters within SLA Industries. These often involve direct contact with Mr. Slayer's inner circle or the deepest secrets of the universe.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The BPN Hall:</strong></p>

<p>Operatives typically receive BPNs from BPN Halls, which are official SLA Industries facilities. These can be chaotic, bureaucratic places, with queues of other Operatives, various characters (psychos, druggies, rival squads), and a permanent presence of Shivers (SLA's corporate police) and Dark Finders (internal affairs) to keep order.</p>

            <summary></summary> 
            <div class="description-content"><p>In <em>Eclipse Phase</em>, the concept of "backing up your PC" and "sleeving/egocasting into a new body" are central to the game's transhumanist themes and core mechanics. Unlike many RPGs where character death is the end, in <em>Eclipse Phase</em>, it's often just a setback.</p>

<p>Here's a breakdown of the game mechanics involved:</p>

<p><strong>1. The Ego and Morphs:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ego:</strong> This is your character's mind, personality, memories, skills, and consciousness ‚Äì essentially, "you." In <em>Eclipse Phase</em>, your ego is digital information.</li>
<li><strong>Morph:</strong> This is your physical body. Morphs can be biological (biomorphs, including vat-grown "pods" or genetically uplifted animals), synthetic (synthmorphs, i.e., robots or androids), or even purely digital (infomorphs). Your morph is effectively gear that your ego inhabits.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Backing Up Your PC (Ego Backups):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cortical Stacks:</strong> Many transhumans have a <strong>cortical stack</strong> implanted in their brain. This small device constantly records and backs up your ego, typically once per second. If your morph is destroyed, the cortical stack can often be recovered.</li>
<li><strong>Uploaded Backups:</strong> You can also manually upload your ego to a computer or secure storage. This is a more deliberate process, often taking about an hour if done from a biological brain via an "ego bridge," or almost instantaneously from a cyberbrain or extracted cortical stack.</li>
<li><strong>Importance of Backups:</strong> Having recent backups is crucial. If your morph is destroyed and your cortical stack can't be recovered, your character essentially reverts to their last successful backup. This means losing any memories, skills, or "Rez Points" (experience) gained since that backup. This mechanic provides real consequences for "death" even if it's not permanent.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. Sleeving into a New Body (Resleeving):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Process:</strong> Once your ego is backed up or recovered, it can be "resleeved" into a new morph. This involves the digital ego being printed onto the new body's brain (for biomorphs/pods) or integrated into its cyberbrain (for synthmorphs). The ego remains conscious during the procedure, experiencing a smooth transition.</li>
<li><strong>Cost and Availability:</strong> Morphs vary greatly in cost, availability, and capabilities. Losing an expensive or highly customized morph can be a significant setback, even if your ego survives. Some morphs might have waiting lists, or require black market acquisition in certain habitats.</li>
<li><strong>Consequences of Resleeving:</strong> While resleeving prevents permanent death, it's not consequence-free.
<ul>
<li><strong>Trauma:</strong> Experiencing morph destruction and resleeving can be traumatic, leading to mental stress or even psychological damage (represented by Lucidity loss and potential Insanity).</li>
<li><strong>Identity Issues:</strong> The philosophical implications of being a digital copy, or even having multiple "forks" of yourself, are a core theme of <em>Eclipse Phase</em> and can lead to roleplaying opportunities and personal crises for characters.</li>
<li><strong>Lost Gear:</strong> Any gear or augmentations that were part of your destroyed morph are gone unless specifically recovered.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>4. Egocasting:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Long-Distance Travel:</strong> Egocasting is a primary method of faster-than-light (or at least faster-than-ship) travel across the solar system. Instead of physically traveling, your ego is digitally transmitted to a distant location, where it can then be resleeved into a new morph.</li>
<li><strong>Transfer vs. Fork:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transfer:</strong> This is the standard method for egocasting. Your ego is transmitted, and the original ego in your starting morph is erased. From the perspective of the ego, it's a seamless journey.</li>
<li><strong>Forking:</strong> This creates a copy of your ego, leaving the original intact. Forking is often legally restricted due to the complex ethical and societal issues it raises (e.g., who is the "real" you? What happens if your fork commits a crime?). It can be used for tasks like sending a beta fork on a dangerous mission while the alpha fork stays safe.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Darkcasting:</strong> This is a covert form of egocasting, often used to avoid detection or for illegal activities.</li>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> Egocasting facilities can be compromised, and there's always a risk of your ego being intercepted, corrupted, or altered during transmission.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>In essence, the game mechanics of backing up your PC and sleeving/egocasting in <em>Eclipse Phase</em> provide a unique approach to character mortality and progression. They enable characters to face incredible dangers without permanent death, while simultaneously introducing new layers of philosophical depth, resource management (morphs are expensive!), and psychological consequences.</strong> This system reinforces the game's themes of transhumanity, identity, and survival in a dangerous, post-apocalyptic solar system.</p>

<li><strong>What they are:</strong> Bonds are short, declarative sentences that describe a PC's relationship with another character. They're about what one character knows about another, or what they've been through together. They don't necessarily dictate how a character feels, but rather the nature of their connection.</li>
<li><strong>Types of Bonds:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Regular Bonds:</strong> These contribute positively to your "bonds stat" with another character.</li>
<li><strong>Negative Bonds (-):</strong> These indicate a more problematic or distant relationship and count as negative towards your bonds stat. For example, "I distrust <strong>_</strong>" would be a negative bond.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Bonds Stat (replaces Hx):</strong> Your bonds stat with another character is the sum of your regular bonds minus your negative bonds with them. This stat is typically capped at +3.</li>
<li><strong>Using Bonds (Aid or Interfere):</strong> When the game calls for a roll that would normally use "Hx" (History), you roll with your "bonds stat" instead. This usually comes into play when you are trying to <strong>aid</strong> or <strong>interfere</strong> with another character. A higher bonds stat makes you more effective at these actions.</li>
<li><strong>Creating Bonds:</strong>
<ul>
<li>During character creation, playbooks often provide prompts to establish initial bonds with other PCs.</li>
<li>During play, specific moves can allow characters to gain new bonds. For example, if you inflict harm on another PC, they might gain a bond like "<strong><em>_ is prepared to hurt me." If you heal someone, you might gain "I have seen _</strong></em> wounded and weak."</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Resolving Bonds and Gaining XP:</strong>
<ul>
<li>At the end of each session, players are encouraged to look at their bonds and choose one they feel is "resolved" (meaning it no longer accurately describes the relationship, or it's been fully explored).</li>
<li>Both players involved in the bond must agree that it's resolved.</li>
<li>When a bond is resolved, the player marks experience (XP).</li>
<li>After resolving a bond, you may write a new bond with any player character. This encourages the ongoing development of relationships.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Maximum Bonds and Forced Resolution:</strong> If you accumulate four bonds with another character, you <em>must</em> choose to resolve one of them at the end of the session. If you gain a fifth bond with someone before resolving one, you might ignore it or remove another bond without the usual benefits.</li>

            <div class="description-content"><p>Unlike many traditional RPGs where a failed skill roll might mean missing a crucial clue and grinding the investigation to a halt, GUMSHOE operates on the principle that <strong>player characters always find the "core clues" necessary to advance the story.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Investigative Abilities:</strong> Characters in GUMSHOE have two main types of abilities: Investigative and General.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Investigative Abilities</strong> (e.g., Forensics, Streetwise, Archaeology, Interrogation, Architecture, Flattery) are specifically for finding information and clues.</li>
<li><strong>General Abilities</strong> (e.g., Athletics, Health, Shooting, Driving) are for performing actions where the outcome is in doubt and failure is dramatically interesting.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Automatic Core Clue Acquisition:</strong> If a scene contains a "core clue" (a clue essential for the investigation to proceed) and a player character has an Investigative Ability relevant to finding that clue, they automatically get it. No dice roll is required. The GM simply provides the information.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Example:</em> If there's a bloodstain (core clue) and a character with "Forensics" investigates, they <em>will</em> find the bloodstain and understand its significance.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Beyond Core Clues: "Spends" and Extra Information</strong></p>

<p>While core clues are automatic, GUMSHOE introduces a "spend" mechanic for deeper or additional information:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Investigative Ability Pools:</strong> Each Investigative Ability has a pool of points. Players can spend these points to gain:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>"Push" for more detail:</strong> Spending points allows a character to glean additional, non-essential but helpful, information from a clue or scene. This might be a deeper insight, a tangential lead, or a piece of background knowledge that fleshes out the mystery.</li>
<li><em>Example (continuing from above):</em> The "Forensics" character might spend a point to determine the victim's blood type, or to realize the blood isn't human, or to deduce the approximate time the blood was shed with greater precision.</li>
<li><strong>Special benefits:</strong> Some spends might unlock unique advantages, narrative declarations, or even provide temporary bonuses to General Ability rolls later on. The specific benefits of spends often vary by the individual GUMSHOE game (e.g., <em>Trail of Cthulhu</em>, <em>Night's Black Agents</em>, <em>The Esoterrorists</em>).</li>
<li><strong>Relationship to Narrative:</strong> The GM is encouraged to make these "extra" clues and benefits compelling and useful, even if not strictly necessary for solving the core mystery. They should enhance the story, provide new avenues for investigation, or give the players a sense of their character's competence and expertise.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Refreshing Investigative Pools:</strong> Investigative Ability points typically refresh between scenarios, or at significant narrative milestones. This encourages players to use their abilities freely within a given investigation without hoarding points.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why This System Works (and What it Achieves):</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Prevents "Stalling":</strong> The primary goal is to ensure the game never grinds to a halt because players missed a vital piece of information due to a bad dice roll or an oversight. The story always moves forward.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Interpretation, Not Finding:</strong> GUMSHOE shifts the focus from the act of <em>finding</em> clues to the act of <em>interpreting</em> them. The challenge lies in piecing together the information, understanding its implications, and deciding what to do next.</li>
<li><strong>Player Agency:</strong> While core clues are guaranteed, players still have agency in <em>how</em> they investigate and <em>what</em> additional details they pursue through spends. This allows them to customize their approach and feel like competent detectives.</li>
<li><strong>Emphasizes Character Competence:</strong> Characters are assumed to be skilled investigators. The mechanics reflect this by guaranteeing success in their area of expertise.</li>
<li><strong>Drives Narrative Momentum:</strong> By ensuring clues are always available, the GM can keep the mystery unfolding at a brisk pace, leading to more dramatic tension and player engagement.</li>
<li><strong>GM Flexibility:</strong> GMs are encouraged to design their mysteries with "core clues" that lead from one scene to the next, often with multiple paths to the same essential information (the "Three Clue Rule" is a common design principle, though not exclusive to GUMSHOE). If players get stuck, the GM can always provide an antagonist reaction or a new scene that reveals more clues.</li>

            <summary></summary> 
            <div class="description-content"><p>InSpectres is a humorous paranormal investigation tabletop RPG that leans heavily into the tropes of reality TV, particularly the "confessional" mechanic. Here's how it incorporates that reality-TV-like feel:</p>

<p><strong>The Core Concept:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ghostbusters meets Reality TV:</strong> Imagine a ghost-hunting company, InSpectres Inc., that's trying to keep its franchise afloat while dealing with all sorts of supernatural annoyances ‚Äì from mischievous imps to full-blown vampires. The game is a blend of ironic horror, tragic comedy, and over-the-top property damage.</li>
<li><strong>Collaborative Storytelling:</strong> Unlike many traditional RPGs where the GM dictates the entire plot, InSpectres encourages players to contribute heavily to the narrative. The outcome of skill rolls often determines not just success or failure, but also allows players to introduce new elements or even redefine aspects of the mystery. This creates a highly improvisational and often hilarious experience.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The "Confessional" Mechanic:</strong></p>

<p>This is the key element that gives InSpectres its reality-TV flavor:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Stepping into the Booth:</strong> At any point during a scene, a player can declare they are going into a "confessional." This is where their <em>character</em> breaks the fourth wall (or, more accurately, speaks directly to the "camera" of the imaginary reality show).</li>
<li><strong>Adding to the Narrative:</strong> During a confessional, a player can do several things:
<ul>
<li><strong>Reveal hidden thoughts or motivations:</strong> What's their character <em>really</em> thinking about the current situation, or about another character?</li>
<li><strong>Introduce new information or "flashbacks":</strong> They can recall a forgotten skill, a piece of equipment they "happened" to bring, or a past experience that suddenly becomes relevant to the current problem. This is a powerful tool for players to influence the direction of the story and inject new twists.</li>
<li><strong>Steer events:</strong> They can use their confessional to suggest how things <em>should</em> go, often in a way that benefits their character or creates more drama.</li>
<li><strong>Comment on other characters:</strong> Like reality TV contestants, they can "dish" on their teammates, adding to character development and potential interpersonal conflict.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>GM as Producer:</strong> The Game Master (GM) often acts as a sort of reality TV producer, sometimes prompting confessionals or encouraging players to "act on their confessions" to further the story and character interaction.</li>
<li><strong>Humor and Drama:</strong> The confessional mechanic is designed to generate both humor (from absurd revelations or character insights) and drama (as characters' true feelings or hidden agendas come to light).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why it Works:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Player Agency:</strong> It gives players a lot of control over the narrative, empowering them to be proactive and creative with the story.</li>
<li><strong>Improvisation:</strong> It encourages on-the-fly thinking and spontaneous contributions, leading to unpredictable and often comedic outcomes.</li>
<li><strong>Genre Emulation:</strong> It perfectly captures the meta-narrative and self-aware humor of reality TV, where characters often comment on the show itself or their fellow participants.</li>
<li><strong>Low Prep for GM:</strong> Because players are so involved in generating plot points and solutions, the GM can focus more on facilitating the game and reacting to player creativity.</li>
</ul>

<p>In essence, InSpectres is a game that doesn't just tell a story about paranormal investigators; it tells a story <em>about</em> a reality show featuring paranormal investigators, with all the dramatic confessionals, unexpected twists, and comedic character moments that implies.</p>

This creates a nuanced system where a skilled character can still struggle with a particularly difficult task, and even a less skilled character might pull off something amazing under ideal conditions.</small></em></p>

            <summary></summary> 
            <div class="description-content"><ul>
<li><p><strong>The Control Die (d20):</strong> This is always a 20-sided die (d20). It represents the core element of the character's attempt to perform an action. You roll this die every time you make an action check.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Situation Die (Variable):</strong> This die represents the difficulty of the task or the circumstances surrounding it. Unlike the control die, the situation die can be various sizes: d0 (meaning no situation die is rolled, only the d20), d4, d6, d8, d12, or even another d20 (or multiple d20s for extreme difficulties).</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Modifiers:</strong> The Gamemaster (GM) determines the size of the situation die and whether it's added to or subtracted from the control die.
<ul>
<li><strong>Positive Situation Die (Penalty):</strong> A positive situation die (e.g., +d4, +d6) is <em>added</em> to your control die roll. This makes the task harder, as you generally want to roll <em>low</em> in Alternity.</li>
<li><strong>Negative Situation Die (Bonus):</strong> A negative situation die (e.g., -d4, -d6) is <em>subtracted</em> from your control die roll. This makes the task easier, as it helps you roll lower.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How the Roll Works:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Identify the Target Number:</strong> Your character has a target number for each skill or action, usually derived from their ability scores and skill ranks.</li>
<li><strong>Roll the Dice:</strong> You roll the d20 (control die) and the appropriate situation die.</li>
<li><strong>Calculate the Result:</strong> Add or subtract the situation die result from your control die result.</li>
<li><strong>Compare and Determine Success:</strong> You then compare this total to your target number. In Alternity, <strong>the goal is generally to roll <em>under</em> your target number to succeed.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Degrees of Success and Failure:</strong></p>

<p>Alternity also incorporates a system of "degrees of success" and "degrees of failure." The further you roll below your target number, the better your success (e.g., Ordinary, Good, Amazing). Conversely, the further you roll above your target number, the worse your failure.</p>

<p><strong>1. Crew Creation:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Crew Type:</strong> This is the foundational choice, defining the group's primary purpose and typical activities (e.g., Assassins, Bravos, Cult, Hawkers, Shadows, Smugglers). Each crew type comes with unique special abilities and informs how the crew earns coin and XP. While not restrictive, it sets the initial tone for your operations.</li>
<li><strong>Starting Tier:</strong> Crews begin at Tier 0, representing their initial standing in the underworld.</li>
<li><strong>Hold:</strong> This indicates how well a faction or crew can maintain its position. Crews start with "strong hold."</li>
<li><strong>Reputation:</strong> You choose an initial reputation (e.g., Ambitious, Brutal, Daring) which influences how other factions perceive you.</li>
<li><strong>Lair and Hunting Grounds:</strong> You establish a physical base of operations (lair) and a preferred district for your activities (hunting grounds). How you deal with the faction claiming that territory (paying them off, gaining status, or taking a penalty) is an early decision.</li>
<li><strong>Special Ability:</strong> Your crew starts with a unique special ability related to its type, offering mechanical benefits.</li>
<li><strong>Upgrades:</strong> Crews begin with a few pre-selected upgrades and choose additional ones. These can be assets like a boat or carriage, cohorts (gangs or expert NPCs), or special facilities like a hidden lair or infirmary. Upgrades can also impact your faction status.</li>
<li><strong>Favorite Contact:</strong> You select a close friend or ally who can offer assistance.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Crew Advancement:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Crew XP:</strong> Similar to character XP, the crew earns XP by meeting specific triggers. These include:
<ul>
<li><strong>Crew-specific trigger:</strong> Related to their chosen crew type (e.g., Smugglers earn XP for successful smuggling operations).</li>
<li><strong>Contending with challenges above your current station:</strong> Taking on higher-Tier targets or more dangerous opposition.</li>
<li><strong>Bolstering or developing reputation:</strong> Actively working to improve or change how the underworld sees your crew.</li>
<li><strong>Expressing the goals, drives, or nature of the crew:</strong> Actions that highlight what makes your crew unique.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Advancement Benefits:</strong> When the crew XP track fills, you can choose a new special ability or mark two crew upgrade boxes.</li>
<li><strong>Profits:</strong> Each time the crew advances, individual PCs gain "stash" (coin) based on the crew's Tier, representing shared profits.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. Faction Game (Reputation and Status):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Rep (Reputation):</strong> This is a measure of your crew's clout and renown in the underworld. You earn Rep from scores, especially by taking on higher-Tier targets. Accruing enough Rep is crucial for advancing your crew's Tier.</li>
<li><strong>Turf:</strong> Seizing and holding territory provides a stable base for your Rep and reduces the amount of Rep needed to advance your Tier.</li>
<li><strong>Hold (Weak/Strong):</strong> This reflects your crew's stability and ability to maintain its position. If your hold becomes weak, your lair might come under threat.</li>
<li><strong>Faction Status:</strong> Your crew has a relationship status with various factions in Doskvol, ranging from +3 (Allies) to -3 (War). Your actions (heists, betrayals, favors) directly impact these relationships.
<ul>
<li><strong>Positive Status:</strong> Allies might offer help, resources, or missions.</li>
<li><strong>Negative Status:</strong> Hostile factions will seek to cause trouble, and being "at war" can lead to penalties like increased Heat and fewer downtime activities.</li>
<li><strong>Managing Relationships:</strong> Balancing alliances and conflicts is a key strategic element of the game.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>4. Heat and Entanglements:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Heat:</strong> Represents the attention your crew attracts from the law and other powerful entities due to your criminal activities. The more overt or violent your scores, the more Heat you accumulate.</li>
<li><strong>Wanted Level:</strong> When your Heat reaches 9, you gain a Wanted Level, clear your Heat (with rollover), and face more serious consequences from law enforcement.</li>
<li><strong>Incarceration:</strong> The only way to reduce Wanted Level is through incarceration, where a crew member, ally, or even a framed enemy takes the fall. This can lead to prison claims and new faction statuses within the prison system.</li>
<li><strong>Entanglements:</strong> After each score, the crew faces an "entanglement" based on their Heat and Wanted Level. These are complications arising from their criminal activities, such as rival gangs seeking revenge, law enforcement investigations, or supernatural occurrences. Entanglements push the narrative forward and often lead to new scores or difficult choices.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>5. Downtime Activities:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>After a score, the crew enters a downtime phase, allowing characters to attend to personal needs and crew projects. Each PC typically gets two downtime activities (reduced to one if the crew is at war). Common activities include:
<ul>
<li><strong>Acquire Asset:</strong> Gaining temporary use of equipment, a cohort, a vehicle, or a service.</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Project:</strong> Working on a complex goal over multiple sessions, tracked with a progress clock.</li>
<li><strong>Recover:</strong> Healing harm from injuries.</li>
<li><strong>Reduce Heat:</strong> Taking actions to lower the crew's Heat level.</li>
<li><strong>Train:</strong> Gaining XP in character attributes or playbooks.</li>
<li><strong>Indulge Vice:</strong> Clearing stress by engaging in their character's chosen vice.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>In essence, crew management in Blades in the Dark is less about meticulous resource tracking and more about the ongoing narrative of a criminal enterprise. Players constantly make choices that affect their crew's growth, reputation, and relationships within the dangerous city of Doskvol, all of which feed back into the next thrilling score.</p>

            <summary></summary> 
            <div class="description-content"><p>The flashback heist mechanic is one of the most innovative and celebrated features of Blades in the Dark. It radically changes the way heists (called "scores" in BitD) are planned and executed, moving away from traditional, often tedious, pre-planning sessions.</p>

<p>Here's how it works and why it's so effective:</p>

<p><strong>The Core Idea: Act First, Plan Later (in Flashback)</strong></p>

<p>Instead of players spending hours meticulously detailing every step of a heist before it begins (which often falls apart the moment the GM introduces an unexpected complication), Blades in the Dark encourages you to <strong>jump directly into the action</strong>.</p>

<p>When the crew decides to undertake a score, they choose a <em>general approach</em> (e.g., Assault, Deception, Stealth, Occult, Social, Transport) and a single <em>detail</em> about that approach (like their point of attack, method of deception, etc.). Then, the GM makes an <strong>Engagement Roll</strong> to determine the crew's initial position when the action starts (Controlled, Risky, or Desperate).</p>

<p>Once the score is underway, and the crew encounters a problem or needs a specific piece of information or equipment, that's when the flashback mechanic comes into play.</p>

<p><strong>How to Use a Flashback:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Encounter a Problem:</strong> The crew is in the middle of a heist. They need a key, a distraction, a specific piece of information, or they realize they should have done something to prepare for this specific obstacle.</li>
<li><strong>Declare a Flashback:</strong> A player declares, "I have a flashback! My character actually did X to prepare for this."</li>
<li><strong>GM Sets Stress Cost:</strong> The GM determines the "cost" in Stress for the flashback, based on how elaborate, unlikely, or complex the preparation would have been:
<ul>
<li><strong>0 Stress:</strong> An ordinary action for which they had easy opportunity (e.g., "I bribed the guard to look the other way, because he's known to be on the take."). This implies something easily done, almost routine.</li>
<li><strong>1 Stress:</strong> A complex action or unlikely opportunity (e.g., "I finessed my pistols into a hiding spot near the card table before the pat-down."). This requires a bit more effort or cleverness.</li>
<li><strong>2 (or more) Stress):</strong> An elaborate action that involved special opportunities or contingencies (e.g., "I studied the history of the property to learn about the ghost that haunts the canal dock, which can be compelled to reveal the hidden vault."). This implies significant prior effort or a highly specific, lucky break.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Perform the Flashback Action:</strong> Once the Stress cost is paid, the player describes what their character did. Often, this requires an Action Roll (e.g., a Sway roll to bribe the guard, a Study roll to research the property, a Finesse roll to hide the weapons). The success or failure of this roll determines <em>how well</em> the preparation worked or if there were any complications during the flashback itself.</li>
<li><strong>Return to the Present:</strong> The results of the flashback immediately impact the current situation. If the flashback was successful, the obstacle might be removed, an advantage gained, or crucial information revealed. If it was a partial success or failure, there might be new complications or the preparation might not have worked as intended.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Key Benefits and Intentions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Emulates Heist Fiction:</strong> This is perhaps the most significant benefit. Think of movies like <em>Ocean's Eleven</em> or <em>Leverage</em>, where the crew encounters a seemingly insurmountable problem, only for a character to have a "flashback" revealing they had already planned for it. This mechanic allows players to feel like competent, resourceful criminals who are always one step ahead, even when they're reacting on the fly.</li>
<li><strong>Reduces Planning Overhead:</strong> It eliminates the need for extensive, often unproductive, pre-game planning sessions. Players don't have to guess every potential obstacle; they deal with problems as they arise.</li>
<li><strong>Keeps the Action Moving:</strong> By jumping straight into the score and using flashbacks, the game maintains a high pace and focuses on exciting moments of tension and resolution.</li>
<li><strong>Focuses Player Attention:</strong> Instead of planning for everything, players react to the immediate fiction. Their "planning" (through flashbacks) becomes highly focused and directly relevant to the current problem.</li>
<li><strong>Resource Management (Stress):</strong> Stress is a crucial resource in Blades in the Dark. Flashbacks aren't "free"; they cost Stress, which is also used to resist consequences and push your actions. This creates a strategic tension: how much can you rely on last-minute preparations before your character becomes too stressed to continue?</li>
<li><strong>Cannot Undo Established Fiction:</strong> A critical rule of flashbacks is that they cannot retroactively change something that has already been established in the current fiction. For example, if the GM said, "There are three guards blocking the door," a player can't flashback to "I assassinated those guards last night." They <em>could</em> flashback to "I bribed those guards last week so they'd be gone by now," which then triggers a roll to see if that worked. The <em>current state</em> is the starting point for the flashback's impact.</li>
</ul>

<p>In essence, the flashback mechanic is a brilliant tool that makes Blades in the Dark feel distinctively like a heist game, encouraging improvisation, quick thinking, and giving players the satisfaction of being cunning criminals, even if their "plans" are only fully revealed after the fact.</p>

            <summary></summary> 
            <div class="description-content"><ol>
<li><p><strong>Non-Chronological Creation:</strong> Unlike most TTRPGs where you play through a story in chronological order, Microscope explicitly encourages you to jump around in time. You can create an event in the far future, then jump back to the distant past to explore its origins, then zoom into a specific moment within that event.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Layers of History:</strong> The history in Microscope is built in three main layers, allowing for that fractal detail:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Periods:</strong> These are large swaths of time, often decades or even centuries. They are broadly defined by a short description and a "Tone" (Light or Dark), indicating if it was generally a good or bad time. You might start with a Period like "The Golden Age of Sail" or "The Era of Nuclear Winter."</li>
<li><strong>Events:</strong> These are more specific occurrences that happen <em>within</em> a Period. An Event is a single, significant thing that occurs, like "The Discovery of the New World" or "The Assassination of Emperor K'tharr." Events also have a Tone.</li>
<li><strong>Scenes:</strong> These are the most zoomed-in level. A Scene is a specific moment-to-moment interaction, where characters are role-played. Scenes always answer a <strong>Question</strong> posed by the player who creates it. For example, within "The Assassination of Emperor K'tharr" Event, a Scene might be "Who betrayed the Emperor?" or "Did the assassins escape?"</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>The "Lens" and "Focus" Mechanic:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Players take turns being the <strong>Lens</strong>. The Lens for a round chooses a <strong>Focus</strong> for that round of play. The Focus can be a Period, an Event, a specific character, a concept (like "Magic" or "The City of Xylos"), or anything that the Lens wants the group to explore further.</li>
<li>During their turn, each player (including the Lens, who gets to make two additions) adds either a Period, Event, or Scene to the timeline.</li>
<li><strong>Crucially, whatever they add MUST relate to the current Focus.</strong> This is how the "fractal" nature is enforced. If the Focus is "The Rise of the Undead King," players will add Periods leading up to it, Events during his reign, or Scenes depicting specific moments within that era.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Zooming In and Out:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>When you create a Period, you're zooming <em>out</em> to a broader sweep of time.</li>
<li>When you create an Event <em>within</em> a Period, you're zooming <em>in</em>.</li>
<li>When you create a Scene <em>within</em> an Event, you're zooming in even further to a specific, role-played moment.</li>
<li>However, players are free to add new Periods or Events anywhere in the timeline, even before the current starting point or after the current ending point, as long as it doesn't contradict something already established. This allows for an organic, non-linear growth of the history.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>No Contradictions:</strong> A key rule is that you cannot contradict anything that has already been placed in the history. This ensures that even with the non-linear creation, the history remains coherent.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Collaborative, Not Consensus:</strong> While the history is built collaboratively, it's not by consensus. Each player, when it's their turn as the Lens or when adding to the history, has creative authority for their specific contribution. This often leads to surprising and unexpected turns in the history, as different players bring their own ideas to the table, and no single person "owns" any part of the history once it's created.</p></li>

            <summary></summary> 
            <div class="description-content"><p><strong>GM Intrusions:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>The GM offers an Intrusion:</strong> At any point, the GM can decide to introduce a complication, setback, or unexpected turn of events. This can be in combat, during exploration, social interaction, or any other part of the game.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> A monster regaining hit points, an NPC seeing through a character's disguise, a cliff collapsing, a crucial item breaking, a new enemy showing up, or even a sudden shift in the environment (e.g., the temperature plummets, a strange light appears).</li>
<li>Crucially, these should not be arbitrary punishments, but rather narrative opportunities to make the story more interesting and dramatic.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>The GM offers XP:</strong> When the GM proposes an intrusion, they immediately offer the player(s) affected by it <strong>two experience points (XP)</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Player's Choice:</strong> The player(s) then have a choice:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Accept the Intrusion:</strong> If they accept the intrusion, they take one of the XP for themselves and immediately give the other XP to another player at the table (explaining why they're giving it to that player). The GM's proposed complication then occurs.</li>
<li><strong>Refuse the Intrusion:</strong> If a player doesn't want the intrusion to happen, they can spend 1 XP they already possess to "buy off" the intrusion. In this case, the intrusion doesn't occur, and the GM takes back the 2 XP they offered. If a player has no XP, they cannot refuse the intrusion.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Automatic Intrusions (Natural 1s):</strong> If a player rolls a natural 1 on a d20 (the dice used for all tasks in Numenera), the GM gets a "free" intrusion. This means the GM can introduce a complication without offering XP upfront, although they still usually <em>do</em> offer XP as a good-will gesture and to keep the XP economy flowing. However, the player can still spend 1 XP to negate it if they wish.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Why Intrusions are so effective:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>GM Tools for Narrative Pacing:</strong> Intrusions give the GM a mechanical way to introduce plot twists, escalate tension, or redirect the narrative when things are getting too easy or too stagnant. It's a structured way for the GM to "fudge" reality for the sake of a better story.</li>
<li><strong>Player Agency and Buy-In:</strong> Instead of the GM simply declaring that something bad happens, players have a choice. This gives them agency and makes them active participants in the narrative. By accepting an intrusion, they are actively choosing to make the story more exciting and rewarding for themselves and the group.</li>
<li><strong>XP Economy:</strong> Intrusions are a significant source of XP in Numenera. This encourages players to accept complications, as XP is vital for character advancement, rerolls, and other abilities. It creates a dynamic where players are rewarded for embracing challenges.</li>
<li><strong>Encourages "Failing Forward":</strong> Because XP is offered, intrusions encourage players to not just avoid failure, but to embrace complications that lead to new story possibilities. A "failed" roll can lead to a more interesting situation.</li>
<li><strong>Collaborative Storytelling:</strong> The act of giving XP to another player encourages a sense of teamwork and appreciation for good roleplaying or clever ideas at the table.</li>
<li><strong>Improvisation Catalyst:</strong> GMs are often encouraged to improvise intrusions on the spot, reacting to the flow of the game and the players' actions. This keeps the game fresh and unpredictable.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Player Intrusions (introduced in later editions like Numenera Discovery/Destiny):</strong></p>

<p>While less frequent and distinct from GM Intrusions, some versions of Numenera also introduce <strong>Player Intrusions</strong>. These are essentially the reverse: a player can spend 1 XP to introduce a beneficial narrative element or solve a problem in a creative, often unexpected way, usually tied to their character's type. For example, a Nano might declare that a strange numenera device they're examining suddenly provides a clue, or a Glaive might declare that a pursuing enemy slips on a patch of loose gravel. The GM still has the final say on whether the suggested intrusion is appropriate, but it further empowers players in the collaborative storytelling.</p>

Every time a player character attempts an action that requires a die roll, they roll a number of regular d6s (determined by their character's "Trait" score, like Brains, Muscle, Moves, or Cool) plus one Ghost Die.
If the Ghost Die lands on the Ghostbusters logo, it means something bad happens to the player character.
When the GM rolls dice for NPCs, especially ghosts and villains, they also include a Ghost Die. However, when a ghost or villain rolls the Ghost symbol, the result is something beneficial for them or detrimental to the Ghostbusters</small></em></p>

            <div class="description-content"><ul>
<li><strong>A Measure of Virtue:</strong> Honor represents a character's adherence to the Bushido code, a strict set of moral and ethical principles expected of samurai and other noble individuals. This code emphasizes virtues like loyalty, courage, benevolence, respect, honesty, and self-control.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on Gameplay:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Social Interactions:</strong> A character's Honor score significantly influences how NPCs (Non-Player Characters) react to them. High Honor typically garners respect, trust, and favorable treatment, while low Honor can lead to disdain, suspicion, and even ostracization. It can affect negotiations, requests for aid, and general social standing.</li>
<li><strong>Combat:</strong> While <em>Bushido</em> is known for its detailed combat, Honor can influence decisions within battle. Dishonorable actions in combat might lead to penalties or negative repercussions, both mechanically and socially.</li>
<li><strong>Skill Progression:</strong> In some versions of <em>Bushido</em>, adherence to the Bushido code can influence skill development. Characters who consistently act honorably might find it easier to advance in certain skills or gain new abilities.</li>
<li><strong>Dilemmas and Choices:</strong> The game often presents players with difficult choices where upholding personal honor might conflict with other goals, such as personal gain or even loyalty to a lord. These dilemmas are central to the <em>Bushido</em> experience.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Gaining and Losing Honor:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Honorable Actions:</strong> Characters gain Honor points by performing deeds that align with the tenets of Bushido. This could include showing bravery in the face of danger, acting with integrity, demonstrating loyalty, or extending benevolence.</li>
<li><strong>Dishonorable Actions:</strong> Conversely, actions that violate the Bushido code lead to a loss of Honor. Examples might include acts of cowardice, dishonesty, betrayal, or cruelty.</li>
<li><strong>Consequences of Low Honor:</strong> A low Honor score can have severe consequences, ranging from a damaged reputation and loss of social standing to more drastic outcomes like being exiled, becoming an "honorless dog," or even requiring ritual suicide (seppuku) to reclaim lost honor.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Role of the GM:</strong> The Game Master (GM) plays a crucial role in adjudicating Honor. They determine what actions are honorable or dishonorable, and how much Honor is gained or lost. This often requires a nuanced understanding of the historical and cultural context of feudal Japan.</li>

            <div class="description-content"><p>"Chivalry &amp; Sorcery" (C&amp;S) is renowned for its detailed, complex, and often simulationist approach to medieval fantasy, and its magic system is no exception. It stands in stark contrast to simpler "fire-and-forget" or "spell slot" systems found in many other TTRPGs. The core philosophy is that magic is a tangible, often dangerous, and physically taxing force that exists in a "Shadow World" and must be actively accessed and controlled.</p>

<p>Here's a breakdown of the key Magick mechanics in "Chivalry &amp; Sorcery" (especially focusing on later editions which refined the system):</p>

<p><strong>1. Vocations (Mage Types) &amp; Faith (Divine Magic):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Distinct Magickal Vocations:</strong> C&amp;S differentiates various types of arcane magic users (Magi), such as Conjurers, Diviners, Elementalists, Enchanters, Hex Masters, Illusionists, Necromancers, etc. Each Vocation specializes in certain "Modes" of Magick.</li>
<li><strong>Divine Magic (Faith/Miracles):</strong> This is handled separately from arcane Magick. Priests and other religious figures perform "Acts of Faith" by invoking their deity. This often costs <strong>Belief Points</strong> (BP) which are less about a finite resource and more tied to the character's success in their Faith skill. Critical successes on Faith rolls can even <em>regain</em> Belief Points, emphasizing the dynamic nature of faith and divine favor. Some Acts of Faith can also cost Fatigue.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Fatigue as the Power Source:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>No "Spell Points" or "Slots":</strong> Unlike many RPGs, C&amp;S doesn't use a generic "mana pool" or "spell slots per day." Instead, arcane Magick is primarily powered by the caster's <strong>Fatigue Points</strong>. This means that casting spells is physically exhausting.</li>
<li><strong>Consequences of Exhaustion:</strong> Pushing a character's Fatigue too low can have serious consequences, reflecting the physical toll of channeling magical energies. This adds a layer of realism and danger to spellcasting. In extreme cases, a spell might even cost <strong>Body Points</strong> (actual life force).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The Two-Step Casting Process (and sometimes three):</strong></p>

<p>Casting a spell in C&amp;S generally involves multiple rolls, reflecting the complex interplay between the caster, the Shadow World, and the target:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Step 1: Accessing Magick (Method Roll):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The caster must first successfully tap into the magical energy of the "Shadow World." This typically involves a skill roll against a relevant <strong>Method of Magick</strong> (e.g., "Command," "Illusion," "Air Magick" for elemental spells).</li>
<li>If the spell is <em>not fully learned</em>, this roll determines if the caster can even attempt the spell. Critical failures can be disastrous, doubling the Fatigue cost or worse.</li>
<li><strong>Learning Spells:</strong> Spells are not just "known." They must be <em>learned</em> by reducing their "Magick Resistance" (MR) to zero through weeks of study or instruction from a master. Once a spell is fully learned, the initial "Method Roll" might be automatically successful.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Step 2: Targeting the Spell (Mode Roll):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>After successfully accessing the Magick, the caster must then "target" their spell onto the material plane, affecting their desired recipient, opponent, or area. This involves another skill roll, often against their <strong>Mode of Magick</strong> (e.g., "Enchanter," "Elementalist").</li>
<li>Success here means the spell affects the target. Failure means the spell is dispelled without effect, though the Fatigue cost is still paid.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Step 3 (Optional): Resistance Roll:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Many spells allow the target a <strong>Resistance Roll</strong> (or sometimes a Dodge roll) to ameliorate or even completely negate the spell's effects. This ensures that even powerful magic isn't a guaranteed "win" and allows for player agency on the receiving end.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>4. Skills-Based System ("Skillskape"):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>C&amp;S uses a percentile-based "Skillskape" system. Magickal abilities are tied to specific <strong>skills</strong>, which are percentage values.</li>
<li>When rolling, you use percentile dice (d100) and an additional "Crit Die" (d10). The Crit Die can modify the success or failure, leading to critical successes (often halving Fatigue cost or enhancing effects) or critical failures (often doubling Fatigue cost or leading to backlash).</li>
<li>A character's <strong>Total Success Chance (TSC%)</strong> for a skill is derived from their Basic Chance of Success, Personal Skill Factor (PSF%), and modifiers. Even highly skilled mages have a chance to miss their target, as there's often a maximum chance of success (e.g., 92% for targeting a spell, meaning a 10% miss rate).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>5. Spell Learning and Advancement:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Time and Effort:</strong> Learning a new spell is not instantaneous. It requires significant in-game time and effort (weeks of constant study or instruction).</li>
<li><strong>Modes and Methods:</strong> A mage chooses a <strong>Mode of Magick</strong> (their specialization, like Conjurer or Diviner) at mastery level during character creation. They then learn various <strong>Methods of Magick</strong> (the "how" of magic, like Air, Fire, Summoning). Knowing a Method well can make learning spells associated with it easier.</li>
<li><strong>XP for Skills, Not Spells:</strong> Characters gain experience points (XP) which are then spent on improving their skills (including Magickal Modes and Methods), rather than simply "gaining levels" that automatically grant new spells.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>6. Nuances and Complexity:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Shadow World Interaction:</strong> The underlying metaphysics of a "Shadow World" from which magic is drawn adds a thematic depth.</li>
<li><strong>Spell Design:</strong> More advanced rules allow for players and GMs to "make up their own spells" by combining basic magick principles (e.g., "create," "detach," "accelerate" for a fireball), which speaks to the system's flexibility for experienced players.</li>
<li><strong>Magickal Devices &amp; Foci:</strong> The rules also include mechanics for creating and using magic items and foci, which can help mitigate Fatigue costs or enhance spell effects.</li>
</ul>

<p>In summary, the Magick mechanics in "Chivalry &amp; Sorcery" are designed to be gritty, realistic (within a fantasy context), and demanding. They emphasize the physical and mental toll of wielding magic, the need for deep study and practice, and the inherent unpredictability and danger of arcane forces. It's a system that appeals to players who enjoy a high level of detail, simulation, and challenge in their fantasy role-playing.</p>

            <summary></summary> 
            <div class="description-content"><p>Unknown Armies 3rd Edition (UA3) has a unique and highly praised mechanic for tracking <strong>collective group objectives</strong> using a percentile system. This system is a core element of how campaigns are structured and provides a strong framework for collaborative storytelling and player agency.</p>

<p>Here's how it works:</p>

<p><strong>1. Defining the Objective:</strong><br />
* <strong>Player-Driven:</strong> At the beginning of a campaign (often in a "session zero"), the entire group (players and GM) collaboratively defines a clear, specific objective that the player characters (the "cabal") want to achieve.<br />
* <strong>Specific End State:</strong> The objective must have a defined end state. "Be popular" is too vague; "Get the Mayor elected" or "Have our cult reach 1,000 members" or "Avert the impending apocalypse of sentient teapots" are more appropriate.<br />
* <strong>Scale:</strong> The GM and players assign a "scale" to the objective:<br />
    * <strong>Local:</strong> Affects a small group, community, or individual.<br />
    * <strong>Weighty:</strong> Impacts a city, large organization, or a significant part of society.<br />
    * <strong>Cosmic:</strong> Changes the fundamental nature of reality or has global/supernatural implications.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Completion Percent:</strong><br />
* Once defined, the objective is given a <strong>completion percentage</strong>, starting at 0%. This percentage represents the progress the cabal has made towards achieving their goal.</p>

<p><strong>3. Advancing the Completion Percent:</strong><br />
* <strong>Actions and Milestones:</strong> The players then undertake actions in service of their objective. These actions are framed as "milestones."<br />
* <strong>Risk and Reward:</strong> The amount the completion percentage increases depends on the risk and effort involved in the action:<br />
    * <strong>Low-risk/Petty actions:</strong> Increase the percentage by a small amount (e.g., 1-5%).<br />
    * <strong>High-risk/Intense actions:</strong> Increase the percentage by a larger amount (e.g., 5-15% or more). The GM decides what constitutes "low" or "high" risk based on the scope and danger of the action.<br />
* <strong>Narrative Driven:</strong> There's no fixed list of actions; players come up with creative ways to advance their goal, and the GM adjudicates the impact on the percentage. This encourages creative problem-solving and ensures the players feel invested.</p>

<p><strong>4. Achieving the Objective:</strong></p>

<p>There are a few ways the objective can be completed:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Reaching 100%:</strong> If the party meticulously works its way through the various milestones and reaches 100% completion, the objective is achieved with ideal success. The group then narrates the outcome, often as an epilogue.</li>
<li><p><strong>"Taking the Plunge" (Rolling for Success):</strong> The party doesn't have to wait until 100%. At any point, if they feel they've done enough, they can "take the plunge."</p>

<ul>
<li>They set up a final, climactic action to complete the objective.</li>
<li>The GM makes a single <strong>d100 roll</strong>.</li>
<li>If the roll is <strong>equal to or less than the current completion percentage</strong>, they succeed!</li>
<li>If the roll is <strong>greater than the current completion percentage</strong>, they fail to achieve the objective, and there are often significant negative consequences (often losing half their accumulated percentage, and possibly facing new, difficult circumstances).</li>
<li>This creates a compelling risk-reward dynamic: do you keep pushing for a higher percentage (safer plunge roll) or attempt to complete it now with a lower chance of success but potentially less effort?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Shortcuts:</strong> In some rare cases, the GM might present a "shortcut" that allows the group to achieve the objective immediately without a roll, but usually with a significant cost or sacrifice.</p></li>
<li><strong>Giving Up:</strong> The party can also collectively decide to abandon an objective. This might be necessary if it becomes impossible or if their priorities shift. They can often salvage half of their accumulated percentage and roll it into a new, related objective.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>5. Campaign Progression and Narrative Flow:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Chaining Objectives:</strong> When an objective is successfully completed (either at 100% or by taking the plunge), if the group defines a <em>new objective that builds on the success of the previous one</em>, the new objective starts with <strong>half of the previous objective's final percentage</strong>. This rewards continuous, evolving narratives and makes campaigns feel cohesive.</li>
<li><strong>Organic Storylines:</strong> This system naturally creates organic storylines. Players define their goals, pursue them, and react to the challenges the GM throws at them in response. The GM knows what the players are trying to achieve, which allows for focused improvisation and prepared challenges.</li>
<li><strong>Focus for Sandboxes:</strong> For a game like Unknown Armies, which often has a sandbox feel, the objective mechanic provides necessary structure and a sense of progression without "railroading" the players.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why it's so Effective in Unknown Armies:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Emphasizes Group Cohesion:</strong> Unknown Armies is often about a "cabal" working together against the strange forces of the occult underground. This mechanic intrinsically links the characters' individual actions to a shared, collective goal, fostering teamwork.</li>
<li><strong>Drives the Occult Underground:</strong> The characters in UA are often trying to fix or understand the bizarre and dangerous world around them. The objectives provide a concrete way for them to attempt to exert influence on that world, even as it grinds them down.</li>
<li><strong>Complications and Hard Choices:</strong> The "taking the plunge" mechanic, in particular, highlights the game's themes of desperate choices and significant risks. Unknown Armies is a game about characters getting battered and transformed by their experiences, and the high stakes of objectives feed directly into that.</li>
<li><strong>Flexible and Adaptable:</strong> It's flexible enough to handle anything from mundane investigations to world-altering occult rituals.</li>
</ul>

<p>The percentile tracking for collective group objectives in Unknown Armies 3 is a powerful and elegant system that provides a clear sense of purpose and progression for the player characters, fostering collaborative storytelling and high-stakes decision-making.</p>

            <div class="description-content"><h3>Personality (Traits)</h3>

<p>Pendragon's Personality system uses <strong>Traits</strong>, which are pairs of opposing virtues and vices. Each knight has 13 such pairings, and the points assigned to each side of a pair always add up to 20. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Chaste / Lustful</strong></li>
<li><strong>Energetic / Lazy</strong></li>
<li><strong>Forgiving / Vengeful</strong></li>
<li><strong>Generous / Selfish</strong></li>
<li><strong>Honest / Deceitful</strong></li>
<li><strong>Just / Arbitrary</strong></li>
<li><strong>Merciful / Cruel</strong></li>
<li><strong>Modest / Proud</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pious / Worldly</strong></li>
<li><strong>Prudent / Reckless</strong></li>
<li><strong>Temperate / Indulgent</strong></li>
<li><strong>Trusting / Suspicious</strong></li>
<li><strong>Valorous / Cowardly</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key aspects of Traits:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Values:</strong> A higher value (e.g., Valorous 18 / Cowardly 2) indicates a stronger leaning towards that side of the trait. Values above 15 are considered "dominant" and have significant mechanical implications.</li>
<li><strong>Rolls:</strong> When a character faces a situation that challenges their personality, the Gamemaster (GM) or even the player might call for a Trait roll. This is typically a d20 roll, where the player tries to roll equal to or under the value of the trait they are attempting to act according to (e.g., rolling under their "Merciful" score to show mercy).</li>
<li><strong>Success and Failure:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Success (roll $\le$ trait value):</strong> The character acts according to that trait. A critical success (rolling exactly the trait value) might grant additional benefits.</li>
<li><strong>Failure (roll $&gt;$ trait value):</strong> The character acts according to the opposing trait (the vice).</li>
<li><strong>Compulsion:</strong> If a trait is very high (e.g., 16+), the character is often compelled to act according to that trait, and a roll may be mandatory. At 20 (meaning the opposing trait is 0), they <em>always</em> act according to that trait.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Experience:</strong> Successful Trait rolls (especially critical successes or those made under duress) often grant "experience checks." During the "Winter Phase" (downtime between adventures), these checks allow players to potentially increase the value of their traits, reflecting personal growth or reinforcement of habits.</li>
<li><strong>Chivalry and Religion:</strong> Certain virtues contribute to a knight's "Chivalry" or "Religious" bonuses, mechanically encouraging players to embody the ideals of Arthurian knighthood.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Passions</h3>

<p>Passions represent a character's deep emotional motivations, strongly held beliefs, and intense feelings. Unlike Traits, which are often internal personality facets, Passions are usually directed outwards towards people, places, ideals, or concepts.</p>

<p>Common Passions include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Honor:</strong> A sense of duty towards proper and noble behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Loyalty:</strong> Duty to a liege, ally, or friend (often specified, e.g., Loyalty (King Arthur)).</li>
<li><strong>Love:</strong> Affection for a person (e.g., Love (Lady Guenever), Love (Family)).</li>
<li><strong>Hate:</strong> Obsessive dislike for a person, nation, or race (e.g., Hate (Saxons)).</li>
<li><strong>Hospitality:</strong> The courtesy of providing shelter and protection to guests.</li>
<li><strong>Amor:</strong> Romantic love for a person (a specific type of Love).</li>
<li><strong>Devotion (God):</strong> Religious fervor.</li>
<li><strong>Station:</strong> A sense of duty to one's social standing.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key aspects of Passions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Values:</strong> Like Traits, Passions have numerical values (typically 3-18 at creation, but can grow much higher).</li>
<li><strong>Bonuses:</strong> When a character's Passion is relevant to an action they are taking, they can "invoke" that Passion to gain a significant bonus (often +5 or +10) to a related skill roll. This allows for heroic, even superhuman, feats. For example, a knight fighting to defend their family might invoke their Love (Family) Passion to gain a bonus to their Sword skill.</li>
<li><strong>Downsides (Melancholy and Madness):</strong> The power of Passions comes with a risk.
<ul>
<li><strong>Failed Passion Roll:</strong> If a player invokes a Passion and fails the associated skill roll, or if they fail a roll directly testing their Passion, they can enter a state of <strong>Melancholy</strong> (hopeless depression) or even <strong>Madness</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Melancholy:</strong> A depressive state, often imposing penalties to future rolls for a period of time.</li>
<li><strong>Madness:</strong> A more severe condition that can take a character out of play for an extended period, requiring them to redeem themselves or seek forgiveness. This reflects the intense psychological toll of failing to live up to one's deepest beliefs in the high-stakes world of Arthurian legend.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Courts:</strong> In some editions, Passions are grouped into "courts" (e.g., Fidelity, Fervor, Adoration, Civility), with a cap on the total points a character can have within each court. This encourages focus on a few defining Passions.</li>
<li><strong>Narrative Impact:</strong> Passions are designed to create dramatic tension and influence character decisions. A Loyal knight might be torn between obeying a cruel lord and upholding their personal Honor, leading to difficult moral dilemmas.</li>
</ul>

    <li>üé≤ <strong>Players have a main goal and stereotype goals linked to the franchise (Ghostbusters)</strong>
        <p><em><small>The goals in the Ghostbusters Roleplaying Game (especially the classic West End Games version) are generally twofold, reflecting both the overarching premise of the franchise and the unique, often comedic, tone of the game:

- Busting Ghosts (and solving paranormal problems): This is the primary, explicit goal for any Ghostbuster. Players take on the roles of Ghostbusters franchise owners/operators, and their main objective in each "adventure" or scenario.

- Achieving Personal Goals: Beyond the immediate job of busting ghosts, each player character in the Ghostbusters RPG also has a personal goal. These goals are often humorous, slightly quirky, and designed to add a layer of individual motivation and character development. Examples of standard personal goals include:
-    Sex: (A clear nod to Peter Venkman's motivations)
-    Wealth: Getting rich off the ghostbusting business.
-    Fame: Becoming well-known and celebrated for their ghostbusting prowess.
-    Soulless Science: Advancing scientific knowledge, often at the expense of social graces or common sense (think Egon).
-    Serving Humanity: A more noble, humanitarian objective.

Why are Personal Goals important?
-    Brownie Points: Achieving these personal goals is one of the ways player characters earn "Brownie Points," which are a unique system in the Ghostbusters RPG. Brownie Points act as a combined resource for experience, character advancement, and even a form of "luck" or "hero points" that can be spent to influence dice rolls or mitigate negative outcomes.
-    Roleplaying Hooks: Personal goals provide excellent prompts for roleplaying, encouraging players to act in ways that align with their character's underlying desires, even when it might complicate the main ghostbusting mission. This often leads to hilarious and memorable moments at the table.
-    Adds Depth to Characters: While the game is lighthearted, personal goals give the characters a bit more depth beyond just being "the guy with the proton pack."</small></em></p>

            <div class="description-content"><p>In "Dogs in the Vineyard," the progression of "Sin" in a community is not just a narrative element; it's a core mechanical and thematic driver for the game. The game is designed to put the player characters, young "Dogs" of God, in morally ambiguous and escalating situations, forcing them to make difficult judgments.</p>

<p>Here's how the progression of Sin typically works within a community (often referred to as a "branch" of the Faith):</p>

<p><strong>The Escalation of Sin (The GM's Tool)</strong></p>

<p>The game provides a clear escalation chain for the GM to build a town's problems. This chain outlines how a seemingly minor flaw can spiral into horrific corruption, drawing in literal or metaphorical "demons." It's generally understood as:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Pride (Initial Flaw):</strong> It begins with a fundamental human flaw, often related to an individual's pride, ambition, resentment, fear, or a desire to maintain social standing. This isn't inherently "sin," but it's the root of what will become so.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Example:</em> A town elder, due to their pride, insists on doing things "their way" even when it's clearly inefficient or causing hardship for others.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Injustice (Pride Enacted):</strong> The pride (or other flaw) leads to an act of injustice. Someone's needs or rights are trampled upon because of another's flaw.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Example:</em> The elder's stubbornness causes the town's water supply to become contaminated, disproportionately affecting the poorer families on the outskirts.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Sin (Rules are Broken):</strong> The injustice leads to a direct transgression of the Faith's laws or the moral code. Rules are broken, and people become bolder in their wrongdoing or more resentful in their victimhood.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Example:</em> To get water, the affected families resort to stealing from the elder's personal well, or the elder actively covers up the contamination and punishes those who complain.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Demonic Attacks (Consequence of Sin):</strong> At this stage, the "Sin" in the community attracts "demonic influence." This is often left ambiguous in the game ‚Äì are these literal demons, or are they a manifestation of the town's internal rot and external pressures? Regardless, the community starts to suffer from seemingly external calamities: raids by outlaws, disease, drought, storms, accidents, unexplained disappearances, etc. These are often targeted, hitting the most vulnerable or those connected to the original injustice.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Example:</em> Bandits begin raiding the affected families' homes, or a mysterious illness sweeps through the impoverished section of town.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>False Doctrine (Blaming God):</strong> Under the pressure of demonic attacks and the pervasive sin, people in the community start to lose faith or develop twisted interpretations of the Faith. They might blame the "King of Life" (God) for their misfortunes, rationalize their sins, or embrace heretical beliefs.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Example:</em> The suffering families begin to whisper that the King of Life has abandoned them, or that the elder's piety is a lie, leading them to question fundamental tenets of their belief.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Corrupt Worship (Enacted False Doctrine):</strong> False doctrine translates into corrupt worship or rituals. People actively engage in practices that defy the true Faith, often to appease the "demons" or to seek power in illicit ways.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Example:</em> Secret gatherings occur where people practice strange rites, make offerings to dark forces, or participate in debauched ceremonies to "solve" their problems, directly violating the Faith's teachings.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>False Priesthood (Organized Corruption):</strong> If corrupt worship gains three or more followers, it solidifies into a "false priesthood." This means an organized group with charismatic leaders who actively propagate the false doctrine and lead corrupt worship, gaining power within the community.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Example:</em> A charismatic figure emerges from the suffering families, leading them in their new, twisted rituals and directly challenging the authority of the legitimate Steward (town leader) and the Faith.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Sorcery (Demons Obey):</strong> A false priesthood that commands obedience from the demonic influences can engage in "sorcery." This means their actions directly manifest as supernatural effects, manipulating the world through dark power.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Example:</em> The false priesthood performs a ritual that causes the elder's crops to wither, or curses their loyal followers with an unnatural blight.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Hate &amp; Murder (The Ultimate Depravity):</strong> The final stage. The community is consumed by hate, leading to violence, murder, and complete social breakdown. The town becomes a lost cause unless drastic action is taken.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Example:</em> The tension escalates to open conflict, leading to assassinations, mob violence, or ritualistic killings within the community.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>The Dogs' Role:</strong></p>

<p>The Dogs arrive in a town somewhere along this progression, often after the "Sin" has already taken root and the "demonic attacks" have begun. Their job is to:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Investigate:</strong> Figure out what the underlying "Sin" is, who is involved, and how it has progressed. The GM reveals information as the Dogs interact with NPCs and uncover secrets.</li>
<li><strong>Judge:</strong> Based on their interpretation of the Faith and their own moral compass, the Dogs must decide how to "cleanse" the town. This is where the core moral dilemmas of the game arise. Will they offer mercy, demand justice, or enact vengeance?</li>
<li><strong>Act:</strong> Use their authority and abilities (including violence, if necessary) to resolve the situation, bring the sinners to account, and restore the community to righteousness ‚Äì or at least, what they deem to be righteousness.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key Points about Sin Progression:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Dynamic and Unpredictable:</strong> While the GM uses the progression as a guide, the players' actions (or inactions) will heavily influence how quickly and in what specific ways the Sin manifests. The town can spiral faster if the Dogs make poor choices or fail to act decisively.</li>
<li><strong>Moral Ambiguity:</strong> The game excels at blurring the lines between good and evil, "sin" and human failing. Players often discover that even seemingly "good" people have contributed to the town's problems, and punishing them can feel incredibly difficult.</li>
<li><strong>Consequences are Real:</strong> The game ensures that every action, especially during conflicts, has consequences. These consequences can affect the Dogs directly (their faith, their relationships, their physical well-being) and further impact the community, sometimes inadvertently accelerating the Sin.</li>
<li><strong>The Dogs are the Authority:</strong> A crucial aspect is that the Dogs possess ultimate theological authority. Whatever judgment they pronounce, that is, in the fiction of the game, God's will. This immense power, coupled with the escalating Sin, creates intense pressure and moral weight on the players.</li>
</ul>

<p>The progression of Sin in Dogs in the Vineyard is a brilliant narrative engine, ensuring that every town the Dogs visit is a powder keg of escalating tension, moral quandaries, and potentially devastating consequences.</p>

            <summary></summary> 
            <div class="description-content"><p><strong>1. Collaborative Character Creation:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pathways System:</strong> Character generation in Smallville is a shared experience. Players don't just build their characters in a vacuum; they collaboratively create their histories and how those histories intertwine.</li>
<li><strong>Visual Representation:</strong> The core idea is to physically draw out this map on a large piece of paper. Each player character gets a square, NPCs (Features and Extras) get circles, and locations get diamonds. Arrows are drawn between these elements to show relationships.</li>
<li><strong>Values and Relationships as Stats:</strong> Unlike many TTRPGs that focus heavily on skills or combat stats, Smallville prioritizes "Values" (e.g., Duty, Glory, Justice, Love, Power, Truth) and "Relationships" (with other PCs, NPCs, or even organizations). These are given dice ratings (e.g., d4, d6, d8, d10, d12).</li>
<li><strong>Relationship Statements:</strong> Crucially, each Relationship and Value has a <em>statement</em> associated with it. This statement defines <em>how</em> the character perceives that relationship or value. For example, a character might have "Love: I would do anything for Lois" or "Power: I need Power to keep myself safe." These statements are vital for driving conflict and character development.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. How the Map Influences Gameplay (the "Drives" mechanic):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Dice Pool System:</strong> Smallville uses a Cortex Plus "roll-and-keep" system. When a character attempts an action, they typically roll dice from one Value and one Relationship that are relevant to the situation. They then keep the best two dice. Other factors like abilities or resources can add more dice to the pool.</li>
<li><strong>Challenging Relationships and Values:</strong> The most powerful mechanical move a player can make is to "challenge" one of their character's Relationships or Values. This happens when their character's actions or beliefs contradict the stated relationship/value, or when another player (or the Watchtower/GM) believes the character is acting in a way that should force them to re-evaluate it.
<ul>
<li><strong>Mechanical Benefit:</strong> When a Drive (Value or Relationship) is challenged, the player gets to roll <em>three</em> times the dice for that Drive (e.g., three d8s instead of one) for that specific roll.</li>
<li><strong>Narrative Impact:</strong> This challenge represents a moment of internal conflict or growth. If the character "surrenders" to the challenge, their relationship statement or value statement might change, reflecting a new understanding or shift in their perspective.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>"Wedging" by the Watchtower:</strong> The GM (known as the Watchtower) is encouraged to create scenarios ("wedges") that specifically put characters at odds with each other due to their conflicting values or relationships. This generates drama and provides opportunities for players to challenge their Drives.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. Benefits of the Relationship Map:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on Drama and Character:</strong> The map forces players and the GM to think deeply about character motivations, connections, and personal struggles. It ensures that the emotional and relational aspects of the game are always at the forefront.</li>
<li><strong>Built-in Conflict:</strong> By defining relationships and values with specific statements, the game naturally creates tension points and opportunities for dramatic conflict, both internal and external.</li>
<li><strong>Shared Storytelling:</strong> The collaborative nature of creating the map fosters a shared narrative from the very beginning. Everyone has a stake in the world and each other's characters.</li>
<li><strong>Mechanically Relevant:</strong> The relationships and values aren't just flavor; they directly impact dice rolls and character advancement, making them integral to gameplay.</li>

            <div class="description-content"><p><strong>1. Runes as Stats (Traits):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Color-Coded Runes:</strong> The 24 Elder Futhark runes are divided into three color-coded categories, each representing a primary Trait:
<ul>
<li><strong>Red Runes:</strong> Physical abilities (strength, agility, combat prowess).</li>
<li><strong>Blue Runes:</strong> Mental abilities (intelligence, perception, cunning).</li>
<li><strong>Green Runes:</strong> Spiritual abilities (willpower, charm, connection to the supernatural).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Essence (Your Rune Bag):</strong> Your character's "Essence" determines how many runes you have in your personal rune bag. As you level up, you can add more runes to your bag, increasing your overall potential. The more runes of a certain color you have, the higher your corresponding Trait score.</li>
<li><strong>Destiny (Runes Drawn):</strong> Your "Destiny" score dictates how many runes you draw from your bag for an action or at the start of a combat round. These drawn runes represent your available actions and immediate capabilities.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Resolving Actions (Wyrd):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Describing the Action:</strong> When a player wants to perform an action, they first describe <em>how</em> they are attempting it. This description helps the Game Master (called the "Norn") determine which Trait (Physical, Mental, or Spiritual) is most relevant.</li>
<li><strong>Drawing Runes:</strong> The player then draws a number of random runes from their bag equal to their Destiny score.</li>
<li><strong>Successes:</strong> Each rune drawn that matches the color of the chosen Trait (based on the action's description) counts as one "success."</li>
<li><strong>Skill Ranks:</strong> If the character has ranks in the relevant skill, each rank adds an additional +1 success.</li>
<li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> The Norn sets a difficulty rating (1 to 5). If the total number of successes meets or exceeds the difficulty, the action succeeds.
<ul>
<li><strong>Partial Success:</strong> Missing by one point results in a partial success, with consequences described by the Norn.</li>
<li><strong>Unexpected Benefits:</strong> Exceeding the difficulty by one or more successes can lead to unexpected benefits, also described by the Norn.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. Runes as Actions and Powers:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Actions Economy:</strong> The runes you draw represent your actions for that turn or situation. If you draw 2 runes, you generally have 2 actions.</li>
<li><strong>Playing Runes for Powers:</strong> Each rune in your hand can be "played" to activate a specific power, maneuver, or spell that your character has learned. These powers are often "bound" to specific runes on your character's unique "playmat."</li>
<li><strong>Generic Actions:</strong> Even if a drawn rune doesn't correspond to a specific power you want to use, you can often play it for a generic action (e.g., a basic attack, movement).</li>
<li><strong>Combinations and Chains:</strong> The system allows for complex combinations. Players can use multiple runes together to amplify a power, target multiple opponents, or achieve more complex effects. This adds a tactical depth, especially in combat.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>4. Runes as Health (Damage and Healing):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Visceral Damage:</strong> One of the most impactful and unique aspects of the Rune Stones mechanic is its damage system. When your character takes damage, you <strong>randomly remove runes from your Essence bag</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Consequences of Damage:</strong> Removing runes from your bag means you can no longer draw those runes. This directly impacts your character's capabilities:
<ul>
<li>You might lose access to specific powers or skills that were bound to those removed runes.</li>
<li>Your overall Trait scores (determined by the number of colored runes in your bag) effectively decrease, making you less effective in future actions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Feeling the Pain:</strong> This mechanic makes damage very visceral. Instead of just tracking hit points, you literally feel your character weakening and losing abilities as they are wounded. Healing involves getting those runes back into your bag.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>5. Player Mat:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Players utilize a personal <strong>playmat</strong> which has designated areas to place runes, track conditions, and visually represent their character's current state and available options. This replaces a traditional character sheet for many aspects of gameplay.</li>

            <div class="description-content"><p>Here's a breakdown of how Dark Secrets work:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Core to Character Creation:</strong> During character creation, each player must choose or generate a Dark Secret. These are not trivial flaws; they are often severe, traumatic, or morally compromising events that have left a lasting mark on the character's soul and psyche. Examples can range from being responsible for a death, having a hidden identity, being involved in unspeakable rituals, or carrying a family curse.</li>
<li><strong>Personal Horror:</strong> Kult is a game of personal horror, and the Dark Secret is central to this. It's meant to draw players into the psychological and emotional depths of their characters, forcing them to confront their inner demons. The horror in Kult often stems from the characters' own pasts and transgressions.</li>
<li><strong>Plot Hooks and Complications:</strong> Dark Secrets are explicitly designed to be plot hooks. The GM is expected to weave these secrets into the narrative, creating situations where the character's past comes back to haunt them. This might involve:
<ul>
<li><strong>Consequences:</strong> Past actions having unforeseen and terrible repercussions.</li>
<li><strong>Revelation:</strong> The secret being close to exposure, putting the character and possibly their companions in danger.</li>
<li><strong>Manipulation:</strong> Malevolent entities (Archons, Death Angels, Lictors, etc.) using the Dark Secret as leverage to influence or torment the character.</li>
<li><strong>Inner Conflict:</strong> The character struggling with the moral weight or psychological impact of their secret.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Unveiling the Illusion:</strong> As characters in Kult awaken to the true, horrific nature of reality (the "Illusion" maintained by the Archons), their Dark Secrets often become intertwined with this revelation. The secret might be a crack in their personal illusion, or a key to understanding a deeper truth about the world.</li>
<li><strong>Not Always Known by the Player:</strong> In some cases, a player might not even know the full extent of their character's Dark Secret at the beginning of the game. This allows for a gradual, terrifying unveiling of the truth as the campaign progresses, adding to the sense of mystery and horror.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on Relationships and Stability:</strong> The Dark Secret can affect a character's relationships with others (both PCs and NPCs). If revealed, it can shatter trust, create animosity, or lead to social ostracization. It also ties into the game's "Stability" mechanic, as confronting or being confronted by one's Dark Secret can lead to a loss of mental fortitude.</li>
<li><strong>Pushing Boundaries:</strong> The Dark Secret mechanic encourages the game to explore mature and often disturbing themes. GMs and players are encouraged to discuss boundaries beforehand to ensure a safe and consensual playing environment, as the content can be deeply uncomfortable.</li>

        <details class="accordion-desc">
            <summary></summary> 
            <div class="description-content"><p>It's important to understand that in <em>Changeling: The Dreaming</em>, changelings are not fairies who replace human babies. Instead, they are <strong>fae souls born into human bodies</strong>. These fae souls have an innate connection to the Dreaming, the mystical realm of imagination and belief, which is constantly threatened by Banality (the mundane disbelief of the mortal world).</p>

<h3>The Seelie Aspect (The Seelie Court)</h3>

<p>The Seelie Court traditionally represents the more "bright" or "traditional" side of the fae, though "good" is too simplistic a label. They are often associated with:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Tradition and Honor:</strong> Seelie changelings are typically staunch defenders of fae traditions, ancient customs, and the chivalric code. Honor, oaths, and keeping one's word are paramount to them.</li>
<li><strong>Beauty and Love:</strong> They value beauty in all its forms, seeing it as a reflection of the Dreaming's power. Love, especially true love, is seen as a powerful force that can transcend obstacles.</li>
<li><strong>Duty and Order:</strong> Seelie are often driven by a sense of duty, whether to their court, their kith (fae "species"), or the Dreaming itself. They strive for order and justice, often acting as peacekeepers and protectors.</li>
<li><strong>Guardians of the Dreaming:</strong> Many Seelie believe it is their sacred duty to preserve the Dreaming and reawaken humanity's ability to dream. They see Banality as their ultimate enemy and fight to maintain the fae connection to the human world.</li>
<li><strong>The Seelie Code:</strong> This code dictates their core values:
<ul>
<li><strong>Death Before Dishonor:</strong> Honor is the highest virtue, and sometimes death is the only way to cleanse a stain on one's honor.</li>
<li><strong>Love Conquers All:</strong> Love justifies almost any action, even if it might seem questionable by mortal standards.</li>
<li><strong>Beauty is Life:</strong> Beauty is an objective quality to be cherished and preserved; ugliness is often ignored or despised.</li>
<li><strong>Never Forget a Debt:</strong> Debts, whether owed or due, must always be repaid. The fae have long memories.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Potential Downsides:</strong> While seemingly noble, the Seelie can be rigid, inflexible, and even cruel in their adherence to their code. Their pursuit of "beauty" can lead to callous disregard for "ugliness," and their strict adherence to honor can lead to seemingly illogical or dangerous decisions. Their sense of duty can be unwavering, even if it leads to personal suffering or the suffering of others.</p>

<h3>The Unseelie Aspect (The Unseelie Court)</h3>

<p>The Unseelie Court represents the "darker," more chaotic, and transformative aspects of the fae. They are often associated with:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Change and Impulse:</strong> Unseelie changelings champion constant change, impulsive action, and the breaking of established rules. They believe stagnation is a form of death.</li>
<li><strong>Freedom and Wildness:</strong> They value personal freedom above all else and often scorn the restrictive codes and traditions of the Seelie. They embrace the wild, untamed aspects of the fae spirit.</li>
<li><strong>Passion and Self-Interest:</strong> Unseelie are driven by passion and their own desires. They are often portrayed as individualistic and pragmatic, willing to use any means necessary to achieve their goals.</li>
<li><strong>Challengers of the Dreaming:</strong> Many Unseelie feel that the Dreaming abandoned them during the Sundering, and thus they owe it no special loyalty. Some even seek to harness or conquer Banality, believing it to be the "true" future, or simply use Glamour for their own power and ambition.</li>
<li><strong>The Unseelie Code:</strong> This code guides their principles:
<ul>
<li><strong>Change is Good:</strong> Security is an illusion; adaptation and constant change are essential for survival. Chaos and discord are fundamental forces.</li>
<li><strong>Glamour is Free:</strong> Glamour (the essence of fae magic and life force) should be used and acquired by any means necessary, not hoarded.</li>
<li><strong>Honor is a Lie:</strong> Honor is a fabrication used to control others. True enlightenment comes from enlightened self-interest and embracing reality.</li>
<li><strong>Passion Before Duty:</strong> Follow your instincts and passions without regard for consequences; live life to the fullest.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Potential Downsides:</strong> The Unseelie's embrace of change and passion can lead to extreme cruelty, manipulation, and disregard for others. Their disdain for honor can make them untrustworthy, and their focus on personal freedom can lead to nihilism or wanton destruction. They are often associated with war, madness, and the exploitation of mortals for Glamour.</p>

<h3>Duality and Legacies in Gameplay</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Two Legacies:</strong> As mentioned, every changeling has both a Seelie and an Unseelie Legacy. These are distinct personality facets that grant different mechanical benefits (often relating to regaining Willpower) depending on which court the character is currently aligned with.</li>
<li><strong>Court Alignment:</strong> A changeling typically pledges allegiance to either the Seelie or Unseelie Court. This choice often dictates their dominant Legacy and how they are perceived by other fae.</li>
<li><strong>Switching Courts:</strong> While rare and often traumatic, a changeling can switch their court allegiance, particularly after a profound personal experience or a major shift in their worldview. This often involves their dominant Legacy changing to the other aspect.</li>
<li><strong>Beyond Good and Evil:</strong> It's crucial to remember that neither court is inherently "good" or "evil." Both have admirable qualities and terrifying flaws. Seelie can be oppressive and rigid, while Unseelie can be agents of necessary change. The game emphasizes the shades of grey and the inherent duality within every changeling. The conflict between the courts is a central theme, reflecting the struggle between preserving the past and embracing the future, order and chaos, and the wildness of the fae spirit versus the constraints of the mortal world.</li>

            <summary></summary> 
            <div class="description-content"><h3>1. The Fortune Deck</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> This is the core deck for action resolution and "divination" within the game. It functions much like a tarot deck, influencing the outcome of events and providing thematic guidance.</li>
<li><strong>Composition:</strong> The original Fortune Deck had 36 cards. It is loosely inspired by the Major Arcana of a tarot deck, featuring cards like "The Fool" or "Death," but also includes original Everway-specific cards (e.g., "Drowning in Armor," "Law").</li>
<li><strong>Mechanics:</strong> When the GM needs to determine what happens, especially in situations where Karma (character abilities, logic) and Drama (plot needs) aren't sufficient, a card is drawn from the Fortune Deck. Each card has symbolic art and two complementary meanings depending on whether it's drawn upright or reversed. The GM interprets the card's meaning in relation to the situation.</li>
<li><strong>Modern Editions:</strong> The <strong>Deluxe Fortune Deck</strong> expands on the original, combining the 36-card Fortune Deck with a new 41-card <strong>Season Deck</strong>, for a total of 77 cards (plus instruction cards). The Season Deck is inspired by the Minor Arcana of a tarot deck, reflecting the passage of time and daily events. These decks can also be used as standalone oracle decks.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. The Vision Deck (or Vision Cards/Packs)</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> These cards are central to Everway's character creation and quest design. They are not used for resolution like the Fortune Deck.</li>
<li><strong>Composition:</strong> The original boxed set included 90 Vision Cards. Modern releases offer these as "Vision Packs" or "Vision Collections," containing sets of 12 or more cards.</li>
<li><strong>Mechanics:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Character Creation:</strong> Players select several Vision Cards (typically five) and use the images and leading questions on the back to inspire their character's backstory, personality, and connections to the world, before assigning numerical stats. This is a signature feature of Everway, emphasizing narrative over mechanics in initial character design.</li>
<li><strong>Quest &amp; Realm Creation:</strong> Gamemasters use Vision Cards in conjunction with the Fortune Deck to design adventures, realms, and plot hooks, drawing inspiration from the scenes and questions presented on the cards.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Art:</strong> The Vision Cards feature a wide array of fantastic art, which serves as a springboard for imagination.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Source Cards (or Spherewalker Source Cards)</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> These cards provide additional art and lore, expanding on the Everway setting and inspiring further details for heroes and quests.</li>
<li><strong>Composition:</strong> The original Spherewalker Source Cards were a 90-card series, often sold in booster packs.</li>
<li><strong>Relationship to Vision Cards:</strong> The art on these cards often overlaps with or expands upon the images found in the Vision Collections.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Key Characteristics of Everway's Card Sets:</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Narrative Focus:</strong> Unlike many TTRPGs where cards might provide random events, Everway's cards are designed to inspire storytelling, character development, and plot twists. They are tools for collaborative world-building and improvisation.</li>
<li><strong>Dice-less Resolution (Optional):</strong> While a GM can still use traditional methods, the Fortune Deck offers a unique, thematic way to resolve actions without dice, encouraging interpretation and narrative flow over pure random chance.</li>
<li><strong>Art-Driven Inspiration:</strong> The beautiful and evocative artwork on all the cards is a crucial element, serving as a visual prompt for players and GMs alike.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> The game emphasizes that the GM has a lot of flexibility in how they interpret and use the cards, encouraging them to prioritize Karma (character abilities), Drama (plot needs), and Fortune (card draw) in a balanced way.</li>

            <summary></summary> 
            <div class="description-content"><p>"Aux Marches du Pouvoir" (On the Steps of Power) is a unique, GM-less TTRPG by Manuel Bedouet that uses dominoes as its core resolution mechanic to simulate political intrigues and the climb up a social hierarchy. Instead of traditional dice, the dominoes are integral to both <strong>narrative framing</strong> and <strong>determining outcomes</strong>.</p>

<p>Here's a breakdown of how dominoes are used in "Aux Marches du Pouvoir":</p>

<p><strong>1. Narrative Framing and Theme Setting:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Initial Draw:</strong> At the beginning of a "narration cycle" (which represents a political scene or event), players draw dominoes. The numbers on these dominoes aren't just for success/failure; they <strong>suggest themes or elements</strong> that must be incorporated into the players' narratives.</li>
<li><strong>Connecting Dominoes and Themes:</strong> Each domino has two numbers (e.g., 2|5). These numbers often correspond to a list of keywords, themes, or narrative prompts provided by the game. When a player draws a domino, they are expected to weave elements related to both numbers into their part of the story. This ensures that the narrative remains focused on the game's political and social themes.</li>
<li><strong>Forcing Complications:</strong> The very act of placing dominoes can be a way for players to introduce complications into the narratives of <em>other</em> players. As one review notes, the "clack" of a domino being placed can signify a new challenge or twist being thrown into someone else's carefully constructed narrative.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Resolution and Influence/Power Tracking:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Player vs. Player (Competitive Narrative):</strong> "Aux Marches du Pouvoir" is a competitive game where players vie for influence and power. The dominoes are the primary way this is tracked.</li>
<li><strong>Gaining Dominoes (Influence):</strong> At the end of a scene or narration cycle, players distribute dominoes to each other. This is crucial:
<ul>
<li>Players gain dominoes when their contributions to the shared narrative (especially the complications they introduce) are deemed more interesting or impactful by the <em>other players</em>. This means success isn't just about achieving a goal, but about creating an engaging story.</li>
<li>The numbers on the dominoes accumulated by a character represent their political influence and standing. A higher total value of pips (dots) on their collected dominoes signifies greater power.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Spending Dominoes (Actions/Effort):</strong> While not explicitly detailed in every public-facing summary, it's typical for domino-based systems to allow players to "spend" dominoes (or specific values on them) to undertake significant actions, overcome obstacles, or activate special abilities. This depletes their influence pool, forcing them to earn more through compelling narrative contributions.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. GM-less Play and Shared Storytelling:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>No Dedicated GM:</strong> The domino system facilitates GM-less play. The shared responsibility of drawing, interpreting, and distributing dominoes means that the narrative is collectively built and guided by all players.</li>
<li><strong>Structured Improvisation:</strong> The dominoes provide a framework for improvisation. Players don't just tell any story; they tell stories that incorporate the themes suggested by their drawn dominoes, and they are motivated to make their stories compelling enough to earn more dominoes from their peers.</li>
<li><strong>The "Schism" in Reviews:</strong> As one review highlights, the game's mechanics, particularly the domino system, can be polarizing. Some players love the highly collaborative and narrative-driven approach, where the "success" is determined by how well you contribute to the overall story and intrigue. Others might find the lack of a traditional GM and the abstract nature of domino interpretation to be less satisfying, preferring more direct action resolution.</li>
</ul>

<p>In essence, the dominoes in "Aux Marches du Pouvoir" are far more than just randomizers. They are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Thematic prompts:</strong> Guiding the direction of the narrative.</li>
<li><strong>Complication generators:</strong> Allowing players to directly impact each other's situations.</li>
<li><strong>Influence trackers:</strong> Representing a character's accumulated power.</li>
<li><strong>A driver for collaborative storytelling:</strong> Encouraging players to craft compelling narratives to earn "points" (dominoes) from their fellow players.</li>
</ul>

<p>This unique approach makes "Aux Marches du Pouvoir" stand out as an innovative example of TTRPG design, leveraging physical components in a deeply narrative and competitive way.</p>

<h1>Map</h1>

<p>While the dominoes drive the <em>narrative outcomes</em> and <em>influence tracking</em>, <strong>the map is the foundational element that grounds the entire game in a physical, strategic space.</strong></p>

<p>Here's how the map is used in conjunction with the dominoes:</p>

<p><strong>1. Spatial Representation of Power and Ambition:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The "Throne" or "Summit":</strong> The map in "Aux Marches du Pouvoir" typically represents a political landscape, often centered around a metaphorical or literal "throne," "palace," or "seat of power." This is the ultimate goal that all player characters (the "ambitious") are striving for.</li>
<li><strong>Locations of Influence:</strong> The map is divided into various locations, each representing a distinct sphere of influence, a faction, a social class, or a key institution within the political entity (e.g., the Royal Court, the Guilds, the Underground, the Military Barracks, the Market District, the Slums).</li>
<li><strong>Character Placement:</strong> Players strategically place their character tokens (often simple markers) on these locations. This initial placement is crucial, as it defines their starting sphere of influence and the immediate resources or connections they have.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Driving Narrative Scenes and Conflicts:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Scene Generation:</strong> A "narration cycle" (a scene or event) often begins with players declaring where their characters are on the map and what they are trying to achieve in that location. This immediately sets the stage for the narrative.</li>
<li><strong>Interacting Locations:</strong> The map facilitates interaction and conflict. If two characters are in the same location, they can directly interact, cooperate, or clash. If they are in different locations, their actions might indirectly affect each other, or they might have to move to a new location to initiate direct contact.</li>
<li><strong>Complications Tied to Location:</strong> When players draw dominoes and interpret their numbers as narrative prompts (as discussed previously), these prompts are often integrated with the current location of their character. For instance, a domino suggesting "betrayal" might be played out in the "Royal Court" location, involving courtly intrigue.</li>
<li><strong>Movement and Stakes:</strong> Moving between locations on the map often represents a strategic decision. It might cost influence (dominoes), require a narrative justification, or expose a character to new dangers or opportunities. The map makes these spatial choices concrete.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. Visualizing Progress and Opposition:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Territorial Control (Abstract):</strong> While not a traditional "territory control" game, the map visually represents who has influence over which parts of the political landscape. A character who has accumulated a lot of dominoes (influence) might metaphorically "control" more areas on the map, even if they don't have literal tokens there.</li>
<li><strong>Visualizing Rivals:</strong> The positions of other player characters on the map immediately show who your direct rivals are in a given location or who might be an indirect threat from afar.</li>
<li><strong>Tracking Events:</strong> The GM-less nature means the map can also serve as a shared visual aid for tracking the consequences of past actions. For example, if a player successfully instigated a riot in the "Market District," the GM (or all players) might collectively agree to mark that area as "unstable" or "dangerous" for future scenes.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>4. Dominoes and Map Interaction:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Dominos Inform Map Usage:</strong> The numbers on the drawn dominoes inspire the narrative, which then plays out <em>on the map</em>. A domino with a "2" and "5" might suggest a clandestine meeting ("2") in the "Underground" (a location on the map) to discuss a betrayal ("5").</li>
<li><strong>Map Influences Domino Interpretation:</strong> Conversely, the specific location a character is in can flavor how a domino's numerical prompts are interpreted. A "conflict" domino in the "Military Barracks" would play out differently than one in the "Diplomatic Quarter."</li>
<li><strong>Strategic Domino Placement/Distribution:</strong> While the core mechanic involves players giving each other dominoes, some interpretations or "hacks" of the system might involve placing dominoes <em>on the map</em> to signify control, a lingering event, or a resource in a specific location. However, this is not a core rule of the base game. The dominoes primarily remain in players' hands to represent their individual influence.</li>
</ul>

<p>In summary, the map in "Aux Marches du Pouvoir" is the <strong>spatial canvas</strong> upon which the political drama unfolds. It provides the setting, defines the arenas of conflict, and helps players visualize the changing power dynamics, all while the dominoes provide the specific narrative prompts and track the ebb and flow of a character's hard-won influence. It's the physical manifestation of the political landscape that players are trying to dominate.</p>

            <div class="description-content"><h3>The Core Problem for Vampires: The Beast and Humanity</h3>

<p>Every vampire has a dual nature: their human intellect and will, and the <strong>Beast</strong>, a primal, predatory urge that constantly threatens to overwhelm them. This Beast drives hunger, rage, and fear, leading to frenzies and, eventually, a descent into animalistic madness (becoming a "wight" or "Wassail").</p>

<p>The default way for a vampire to resist the Beast is through <strong>Humanity</strong>. This Path represents a vampire's adherence to mortal morality, empathy, and social norms. The higher a vampire's Humanity rating, the more closely they resemble a human, mentally and emotionally. However, the very act of being a vampire ‚Äì feeding on blood, killing, manipulating, existing as a predator ‚Äì constantly chips away at Humanity. Performing actions considered "sins" by human morality causes a vampire's Humanity score to drop. A low Humanity score means the vampire is more susceptible to the Beast, and risks falling into permanent Wassail.</p>

<h3>The Purpose of Paths of Enlightenment</h3>

<p>This is where Paths of Enlightenment come in. For many vampires, especially those who have existed for centuries or those who reject the Camarilla's attempts to maintain a semblance of human morality, the Path of Humanity becomes untenable. It's a constant, losing battle against their true nature.</p>

<p>Paths of Enlightenment offer an <strong>alternative moral compass</strong>. Instead of trying to cling to human ethics, a Path provides a new, often alien, philosophical framework that allows a vampire to reconcile their existence as a predator with a code of conduct. The goal is still to resist the Beast and maintain sanity, but by redefining what constitutes "right" and "wrong" for an undead being.</p>

<h3>How Paths Work (Mechanically and Conceptually)</h3>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Hierarchy of Sins:</strong> Each Path has its own unique "Hierarchy of Sins." These are actions that cause a vampire following that Path to lose their Path rating (similar to how Humanity is lost). What might be a terrible sin on the Path of Humanity (e.g., casual murder) might be a lesser transgression, or even a necessary action, on another Path (e.g., the Path of the Beast or Power and the Inner Voice). Conversely, actions considered trivial by humans might be grave sins on a Path (e.g., showing compassion on the Path of Metamorphosis, or sharing knowledge on the Path of Caine).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Virtues:</strong> In older editions, Humanity was tied to the virtues of Conscience and Self-Control. Paths often replace these with new virtues like <strong>Conviction</strong> (the strength of one's belief in their Path's tenets) and <strong>Instinct</strong> (the ability to ride the Beast's urges rather than suppress them). These new virtues influence rolls to resist frenzy and other Beast-driven behaviors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roleplaying and Philosophy:</strong> Adopting a Path is not just a mechanical choice; it's a profound philosophical shift. A character on a Path truly believes in its tenets and strives to live by them. This often means embracing a colder, more alien perspective on life, death, and morality. A vampire on a Path is not necessarily "evil" in a human sense, but their worldview is fundamentally non-human.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sect Affiliation:</strong> Paths are most commonly associated with the <strong>Sabbat</strong> sect, who actively reject Humanity and embrace their monstrous nature. Many Sabbat vampires are taught a Path upon their Embrace. The <strong>Camarilla</strong>, on the other hand, largely enforces the Path of Humanity to maintain the Masquerade and blend with human society. Independent clans and Anarchs might also follow Paths, though it's less common or accepted than within the Sabbat.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Difficulty of Switching:</strong> Moving from Humanity to a Path (or from one Path to another) is a difficult, arduous process. It requires intense self-reflection, often the guidance of a mentor, and a successful series of rolls. Failure can result in the vampire falling into Wassail.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Examples of Paths of Enlightenment</h3>

<p>Vampire: The Masquerade has presented many Paths over its editions, each with its own unique philosophy. Here are a few common examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Path of the Beast (or Feral Heart):</strong> Embraces the vampiric Beast as the true self. Survival, strength, and primal instincts are paramount. Control of the Beast comes from understanding and indulging its nature within a structured framework, not denying it.</li>
<li><strong>Path of Caine:</strong> A deeply religious and scholarly Path, focused on understanding the curse of Caine (the first vampire) and the origin of their species. Knowledge, prophecy, and adherence to ancient laws are key.</li>
<li><strong>Path of Power and the Inner Voice:</strong> Focuses on personal strength, dominance, and the pursuit of power. Weakness is abhorrent, and others are seen as tools to be used. Self-mastery is achieved through relentless ambition.</li>
<li><strong>Path of Honorable Accord:</strong> A strict, chivalrous code of conduct, emphasizing loyalty, honor, and adherence to one's word. Often seen among older, more traditional vampires, even within the Sabbat.</li>
<li><strong>Path of Death and the Soul:</strong> Concentrates on the mysteries of death, the afterlife, and the spirit world. Practitioners are often necromancers, seeking to understand the transition between life and unlife.</li>
<li><strong>Path of Metamorphosis:</strong> A deeply philosophical and often disturbing Path, primarily followed by the Tzimisce. It involves constantly evolving one's physical form and spiritual being, transcending the limits of the flesh to achieve a higher state of existence. Compassion and attachment are sins, as they hinder true evolution.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Impact on Gameplay</h3>

<p>Paths add immense depth to Vampire: The Masquerade:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Moral Dilemmas:</strong> They create unique moral dilemmas for players. What is a "good" choice for a human might be a "sin" for a vampire on a Path, and vice-versa.</li>
<li><strong>Character Development:</strong> A vampire's Path defines their worldview and motivations, offering rich opportunities for roleplaying and character development.</li>
<li><strong>Sect Identity:</strong> Paths reinforce the ideological differences between the various vampire sects, especially the Camarilla (Humanity) and the Sabbat (various Paths).</li>
<li><strong>Personal Horror:</strong> The struggle to maintain one's Path rating against the constant pull of the Beast, and the terrifying prospect of falling into Wassail, are central to the game's theme of personal horror.</li>
</ul>

<p>In essence, Paths of Enlightenment are a central pillar of Vampire: The Masquerade, allowing players to explore the complexities of vampiric existence beyond simply "good" or "evil," embracing the monstrous while still retaining a semblance of control and purpose.</p>

            <summary></summary> 
            <div class="description-content"><p>The Free Universal (FU) TTRPG is known for its narrative-focused resolution mechanic, which uses a "Yes/No, And/But" system to drive the story forward. Here's a detailed breakdown of how it works:</p>

<p><strong>Core Concept:</strong></p>

<p>Instead of precise numerical outcomes, FU focuses on qualitative results that push the narrative in interesting directions. When a player attempts an action with an uncertain outcome, they roll dice to determine the result, which falls into one of four categories:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Yes, And:</strong> The action succeeds, and something extra positive happens or a new advantage arises.</li>
<li><strong>Yes, But:</strong> The action succeeds, but with a complication, a cost, or a new disadvantage.</li>
<li><strong>No, But:</strong> The action fails, but something positive or interesting still happens, or a new opportunity arises from the failure.</li>
<li><strong>No, And:</strong> The action fails, and something extra negative happens or a new complication arises.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Rolling Mechanic (General Principle):</strong></p>

<p>While there can be slight variations or "hacks" of the FU system, the general principle for rolling is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Formulate a Question:</strong> The player describes their character's action as a clear, closed "yes/no" question. For example, "Can I leap across the chasm?" or "Do I convince the guard to let me pass?"</li>
<li><strong>Determine Dice Pool:</strong> The player gathers a small pool of dice (often d6s).
<ul>
<li>They typically start with a base number of dice (e.g., one or two).</li>
<li>Additional dice are added for any <strong>helpful Descriptors</strong> (character traits, skills, advantages, favorable circumstances).</li>
<li>"Danger dice" (or negative dice) might be added for <strong>disadvantages, complications, or hindering circumstances</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Roll and Interpret:</strong> The player rolls the dice. The outcome determines which "Yes/No, And/But" result applies.
<ul>
<li>Often, the system involves canceling out opposing dice (e.g., a "hit" die cancelling a "danger" die) and then interpreting the highest remaining die or the combination of results.</li>
<li>Some versions use a simple d6 roll where specific numbers correspond to the different outcomes (e.g., 6 = Yes And, 5 = Yes, 4 = Yes But, 3 = No But, 2 = No, 1 = No And).</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>The "Yes/No, And/But" Outcomes in Detail:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Yes, And (Strong Success):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Effect:</strong> The character achieves their primary goal.</li>
<li><strong>Narrative Driver:</strong> The "And" introduces a bonus, an unexpected benefit, a favorable consequence, or opens up a new positive avenue for the story.</li>
<li><strong>GM's Role:</strong> The GM describes the success and elaborates on the added positive element, pushing the narrative forward in a beneficial way for the player.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> "Yes, you successfully disarm the bandit, AND you find a valuable key in his pouch!"</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Yes, But (Success with Complication):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Effect:</strong> The character achieves their primary goal.</li>
<li><strong>Narrative Driver:</strong> The "But" introduces a negative consequence, a cost, a new problem, or a limited success. The player got what they wanted, but it came with a price.</li>
<li><strong>GM's Role:</strong> The GM describes the success but immediately follows it with a drawback, forcing the players to deal with a new challenge.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> "Yes, you manage to leap across the chasm, BUT your arm scrapes against the sharp rock, and you'll need to tend to that wound soon."</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>No, But (Failure with Opportunity):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Effect:</strong> The character fails to achieve their primary goal.</li>
<li><strong>Narrative Driver:</strong> The "But" introduces a silver lining, a partial success, a new piece of information, or an unexpected opportunity that arises from the failure. It mitigates the failure somewhat.</li>
<li><strong>GM's Role:</strong> The GM describes the failure but immediately follows it with a new angle or a positive twist that prevents the story from stalling.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> "No, you can't convince the guard to let you pass, BUT you overhear him talking about a secret back entrance the Captain uses."</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>No, And (Strong Failure/Complication):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Effect:</strong> The character fails to achieve their primary goal.</li>
<li><strong>Narrative Driver:</strong> The "And" introduces an additional negative consequence, a worsening of the situation, or a new and significant problem. This is a clear setback.</li>
<li><strong>GM's Role:</strong> The GM describes the failure and amplifies the negative outcome, increasing the stakes and creating a more challenging situation.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> "No, you don't manage to disarm the bandit, AND he calls for reinforcements who are now closing in on your position!"</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why this Mechanic is Effective in FU:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Narrative Focus:</strong> It inherently encourages dynamic storytelling by ensuring that every action, regardless of success or failure, moves the plot forward in an interesting way.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced Stalling:</strong> Unlike binary pass/fail systems, there's always a "hook" for the GM and players to build upon, preventing dead ends or repetitive actions.</li>
<li><strong>Player Engagement:</strong> Players are constantly reacting to the evolving narrative, not just waiting for a pass/fail result. The "but" and "and" elements often present choices or new challenges they need to address.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> It's "universal" because this qualitative outcome system can be applied to virtually any action in any genre, from social interactions to combat, investigation, or exploration.</li>
<li><strong>GM Empowerment:</strong> The GM has clear guidelines for how to interpret dice rolls and inject new narrative elements, even without extensive pre-planning.</li>
</ul>

<p>The "Yes/No, And/But" system is a cornerstone of Free Universal TTRPG's design philosophy, promoting fluid, improvisational, and engaging gameplay.</p>
